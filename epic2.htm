</span>In the days past the forces of evil have always been many and powerful,
and few have been the years of Oerth that has not seen strife and conflict
between those forces, and the forces of good and justice. So it was in those
days that a cult of great evil did form in the lands south of The Olve Nation of
Celene and the Great Lake Nyr Dyv in the land known to its people as Verbobonc,
under the worship of a dark god called the Elder Elemental Eye, and their
minions did blacken the land with filth and death, and the people did cringe and
weep, and cry out for heroes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As is
the way of such things, heroes rose, from the common people they came and twice
they threw down the dark worshipers and their minions and for many years the
people remembered what it was to live in peace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Families were raised, homes were built, and men prospered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But men are often foolish, and time dulls the pain of old wrongs done,
and has happens, people forgot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
watch slackened on the Terrible Temple; slackened, faltered, and ultimately
failed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Evil was allowed to return.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Again strife rent the land asunder, and great Heroes were needed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The tale of the Second Rise of The Temple of Elemental Evil is a great
one, full of noble deeds, and great wonders, as well as terrible tragedies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such a tale cannot be told in full here, but suffice to know that the
Evil was once again driven out, and again the land slept quite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And again, men forgot.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thus once more, did evil rise, for evil cannot truly be driven out, only
subdued, and the story that was told in the days of the Second Rise now simply
continues, for the true stories do not end, only come to the present for those
living then to join them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And in
the present in those days evil was waxing again, and the people cried out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus did heroes rise in the land of Verbobonc, between the mountains, and
the Lake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Already they were great
men, fresh from victory driving the evil from the Sunless Citadel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Long from now will glasses be raised in toast to their names, common in
the mind as household words, they will ring through the ages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Great Elf Numenarh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Strong
as a Bear and quicker and slyer than a Fox, he stood bright and tall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Of such great skill with the bow he was that he could pluck the eye from
a sparrow in mid-flight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And so
keen of sight he could track the same on a cloudy day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Quadro, the Great Dwarven Battle-Mage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His shoulders were wide as a Wagon Spit, and his arms strong as the roots
of the old mountains and his Axe gleamed even in the darkness and hungered for
the blood of wicked things, yet as keen as his axe was, even keener was his
mind, and the mysteries of the unseen were laid bare before his most casual
attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Never has a Dwarf before
known so many great and secret things, and never shall they again, not though
the Lortmils themselves crumble with age, and the seas dry up under the Sun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mewn Riverflow, also traveled with them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A Rouge of legendary skill she was able to disappear like a wisp of smoke
in a hurricane, and silent as the Quag on a moonless midnight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quick enough to slip the gold from the pocket of a king on his throne
surrounded by a hundred guards, yet so beautiful that all she needed do was but
ask and it would be hers. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tyro the Wild, a Druid of great power, joined the hero’s in Hommlet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Raised by Wolves as a child, all the beasts of the field were his to
command and he in his eyes showed back the untamed fury of the creatures he
commanded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the subjects are to a
Lord, so were all the forests animals to he.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In battle he fought like a Bear, ferocious and unyielding, strong and
deadly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, I, the great Julin
Sander, Bard Extraordinaire, and teller of this tale, traveled as a Hero, aiding
with a quick sword and a voice of Magic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Assisting
the heroes was a Cleric of St. Cuthbert known as Rask, who ministered to both
souls and wounds, and to who’s holy presence no Undead could stand, and a
young child named Meepo, who the Heroes had rescued from Kobolds, and of whom we
were caring for<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Such were the heroes that battled in the Third Rise of the Temple of
Elemental Evil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The story is a
great one, full of Magic and Mystery, Betrayal and Honor; it is a story of
Heroes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let it begin.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The story begins as so many other great tales begin, with a simple task,
to be performed over the span of a few days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Companions and I arrived in the small town known as Hommlet, after
being hired by the Druid Tyro to look into the strange doings of his current
master, who was now missing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
those days the power of the Temple was only beginning to grow, and men still
spoke lazily in afternoons and took no mind of the foul shrine so close to them,
for they felt safe, thinking the evil in it long dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The only thought ever given the Temple was that Gnolls had taken up
residence in the Temple Proper, and men grumbled that they should someday soon
be removed least they become a nuisance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Had
they been less complacent they would have seen such an event for what it was,
for that was the beginning of the re-population of the Temple with Foul Things.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, the Companions felt things were amiss, and following leads,
traveled to the Moathouse of the Temple, the least of it’s outbuildings, to
search for the old missing druid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
single days ride they took from the civilization of Hommlet, to this Moathouse,
a building to which its neighbors gave no mind, and thought of as a relic of the
past.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>During this time the Elf Numenarh took a short leave of the Companions,
for during this peaceful time even his great hero’s heart was complacent and
he was confident of his friends’ strength, and his love waited for him in the
grove of his home to wed him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus
the Companions went without him and did not know the danger into which they
rode.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They approached the old
Moathouse, ruined and broken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Moat, once swiftly flowing, was now stagnant and foul things lived there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The woodwork had long since collapsed under the weight of age, only the
stone walls stood as a hollow reminder of the past.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ancient place looked like a tomb, and smelled like
a charnel house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A place for only
the long dead, surely.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, all was not as it appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After long riding it came to pass that Numenarh came upon an old tracker
traveling the ways near Hommlet and the tracker beseeched the Elf to stop for he
saw he had the look of a hero.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>“Halt please, noble Elf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Surely,”
said the ancient tracker, “you must be a great warrior, for none here carry
such fine weaponry and such a noble mantle.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>“Yea,” replied Numenarh, “a hero I am, old father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What service I may offer you is yours, though I bid you make haste, for
my love waits for me and I would not tarry long.” he replied glancing
anxiously northward.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The old man grew anxious and spoke quickly “Surely great is indeed my
need, for I passed a group of heroes riding West this very day, though they did
not see me I think.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If they be
friends of yours then I would bid you take a message to them as swift as you
may, for they are riding into great danger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Not two days before I saw something which turned my blood to ice:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A Dragon, it was, terrible in size and fury, and perilously close to
where thy companions traveled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Normally,
for such heroes I would not fear, but they do not know the peril into which they
go”.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>And a shadow fell over Numenarh’s heart, and he knew his friends were
walking into great danger, and so forgetting his love, he turned and spurred his
horse rode like the wind.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>But the Companions knew none of this and approached the
Moathouse at ease, for many had told them it had been abandoned for long years
and the townsfolk themselves often visited in the hopes of uncovering hidden
wealth none had found for in long years since the evil was driven out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Truly the Moathouse looked and seemed dead, and for good reason.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Companions entered unafraid.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As they entered into the Courtyard, littered with fallen stone and
covered with the dust of ages, did the Dragon come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It came from the sky like the roar of a Waterfall, and with all the
inevitability of sunset and it perched Itself atop the crumbling tower of the
Moathouse.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Mighty it was, a great Old Wyrm.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Long of Tooth and hot with Fury.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Its scales were the blue of a clear pool and lightning seemed
to crackle around it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its wings
were like great Sails, and it claws like curv’ed lances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As it sat atop the tower, the building listed and shuddered under its
mighty girth, but the creature paid it no mind, and it addressed the Companions:<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>“Begone!”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Its voice boomed like Thunder and the ground shoot with its
power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“This Land do I claim as
my own and if you value your lives Heroes I would not tarry here long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My temper is short and my wrath quick and you would not live to see the
end of it, I think”.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But though the Dragon was old and Mighty, the Companions did not fear it,
for such is the business of Heroes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
stepped forward and spoke, “Foolish creature,” I said “we do not parley
with the cruel likes of you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your
choices are thus:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Begone from this
place and darken this land no more, or die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No other terms shall be acceptable”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>“Then you shall all Burn,” said it.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thus was battle met.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Dragon plunged down from the tower, driving its terrible weight forward, it
swept towards the companions, who met it with steel bared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The battle that resulted was terrible, and the sound and Magic released
could be heard and seen for miles around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Dragon swept past again and again, lashing out with tooth, claw and tail with
each pass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Axe of Quadro was
red with blood, and death flew from his fingertips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mewn’s arrows streaked forth in a hail, and even Rask called upon a
holy Apparition to hary the beast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
though the Heroes wounded it mightily, the fury of the dragon wore down on them
as well, and none escaped without mark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
time the cunning old Wyrm drew up above us and beat his mighty wings, so that
the dust and sand and rocks rose into the air vision was obscured and nothing
could be seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then were things
grim for the Companions, for the Dragon struck out with Lightning and Magic and
they were hard set upon and their courage began to fail in the Darkness of the
Dragon’s cloud.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was then, in
this dark time, that Numenarh came, riding like a Thunderbolt, bow singing a
song of death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His arrows found
their mark again and again and the Wyrm drew back in fear at the fury of his
coming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But bested it was not, for
it drew back it’s breath and let loose a mighty Lightning bolt from it’s
mouth and it struck down Quadro and wounded Numenarh grievously, so that all
thought both were slain and in their hearts a shadow grew and though they
continued to stand against it as Heroes do they quailed thinking surely the end
had come for them all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But burned
and broken Numenarh rose unsteadily, for blood was on his face and his armor and
his steed lay dead, but rose he did and raised his bow, unruined against all
odds, and leveled his last arrow against the great beast, who stood in wonder at
his courage.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>“Foul Beast”, he spat “return to the dark realm that spawned you,
for I will suffer you no more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your
doom is come.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>And his arrow streaked forward and struck the Dragon in its neck, and the
creature heaved forward for the last time and fell dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus did Numenarh, at the last moment possible, save his Companions from
certain doom and remove a great evil from the world.</span><span style="font-size:20.0pt;

<p><b>Overview:&nbsp; </b>The Viscounty of Verbobonc is a near independent
province of the Archclericy of Veluna, in palatine by a powerful viscount. The town
of Verbobonc itself is the second largest port on the Velverdyva River bringing much wealth to the local lords.
The writ of the viscounty extends some fifteen miles the Kron Hills to the south, though the current
gome troubles ensure that the viscount holds little power there. Though relations with
the lords of neighboring villages and strongholds within the viscounty are not nearly as
tumultuous, Viscount Wilfrick's inattentiveness during the latter part of his reign has
ensured that some local rulers have power than they ought not to have, a problem
that current viscount, Langard, must deal with on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Verbobonc is not only a human city, but is home to many elves and gnomes, as well. A few of them live in lofted ipt-houses, structures built
within the boughs of trees of the same name. Most gnomes live in "rents," small but comfortable dwellings excavated
from the dozens of small hills within the city proper.</p>
<p>The town is rich with trade. The river brings goods of all stripe, with caravans and barges more than happy to leave the region loaded down with
gems and copper from local mines. Verbobonc's gnome smiths are renowned across the Flanaess.
(Arguably, their most important structure, the Royal Furyondian Mint, spreads their handiwork farther than any other.)&nbsp;</p>
<p> The local temperate is mild, featuring cold winters with little snow. The people of
Verbobonc are friendly but cautious--most have seen evidence of true evil in their lifetimes, and know that a stranger could as easily slice your throat
as look at you. The folk of Verbobonc have channeled this caution into a diligent work ethic. "Hard work keeps the demons away" is a popular local
proverb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite its small size, Verbobonc boasts both a religious and secular army. The First Army of the Church is little more than a collection of
club-bearing zealots, beaten so often by the Cuthbertine Overseer Branditan (LG male human Ftr6/Clr2 of St. Cuthbert) that they have become a formidable
and well-trained force. This body numbers perhaps two hundred men and women. The Viscount's Standing Army consists of six hundred pikemen, cavalry and
archers, nominally led by the extremely aged (and increasingly disabled) Mayor Velysin
(NG male human Ftr11). In times of great need, these troops are bolstered by rangers from the
Gnarley, contingents of clerics from Veluna, and the famous Bootmen of Furyondy's Duchy of the Reach.
An alarming number of adventurers can be found in the viscounty, augmenting the resident
forces in unpredictable, often destructive, ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orders of knighthood are few and small in Verbobonc, though the new viscount recently proposed sponsoring a local branch of the Knights of the
Hart. Though controversial (as no love is lost between the town and the Knights of Furyondy), it appears the proposal is gaining widespread public
support so long as the knights were loyal first to their homeland, not to foreigners.</p>
<p><b>History:</b> Long before the coming of humanity, Verbobonc was an elven settlement, a small but impressive river town filled with tall, thin towers,
narrow walkways and delicate wood and ceramic statuary. The local elves shared their
lives and livelihood with the good gnomes of the Kron Hills, banding together to battle off threats
from the north and east. Verbobonc, then, was a military town, aligned with the gray elves of Enstad, though a
political entity unto itself. The surrounding hillocks still hold relics of those ancient days, slowly crumbling rowers of unsurpassed beauty,
troves of buried arrowheads and still-useful armor, and even, it is said, the elven Old Places, sacred refuges hidden in the magical folds of
the world.</p>
<p>As civilized humans entered the Flanaess and most elves receded into the woodlands,
Verbobonc gained importance as a trade port on the Velverdyva River. At this time, many elves quit Verbobonc, leaving the town to
the gnomes and the new arrivals. Thus began a new period in the history of the region, in which
the two races worked together to improve and grow Verbobonc into a state of its own, not beholden to any greater power. At the dawn of
the first century CY, the two primary races of Verbobonc encircled their home with walls, and constructed hundreds of new buildings, mixing a
distinctly gnome architecture with the existing elven structures. In this spirit was
the slogan "Earth and Stone, Man and Gnome" carved above the city's north gate, a motto and approach to life
that endures to this day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The viscounty was formally incorporated into Veluna and the viceroyalty of Ferrond
in 119 CY. Thereafter, it served as Veluna's primary river port, a fact that made it a primary target of Keoish aggression during the
Short War.&nbsp; It was saved from annexation by the Treaty of Devarnish, much of the
western land of the viscounty was nonetheless occupied. The looming Castle Estival, just
east of the Iron Wood, is a telling example of how deeply the soldiers of Keoland influenced the region in the mid-fourth century CY. When Keoland
withdrew from Veluna following the Short War, Verbobonc grew distant from Mitrik. Its viscount still sent a delegate to sit on
the Celestial Order of the Moons, but never again would the citizenry be considered completely
willing vassals. In these years, the church of Sr. Cuthbert came into great prominence in Verbobonc, displacing Raoan clerics in important government
roles.&nbsp;</p>
<p> The trading town might have fallen from the gaze of history if not for the development, in the late 550s, of a nexus of
evil just south of the town, in the Kron Hills. This outpost, the infamous Temple
of Elemental Evil, soon became a beacon for vile men from across the Flanaess. These folk
raided local caravans with impunity, constantly threatening the hill folk and local gnomes. By 568 CY, it became clear
that the villains had established an army, and the following year saw a great battle
between this horde and the forces of Verbobonc, Veluna and even Furyondy. Elves from
the Gnarley proved vital to the success for the side of weal, and the Horde of Elemental Evil was scattered at the
Battle of Emridy Meadows. Powerful mages and clerics sealed the temple with arcane bindings, claiming to have trapped
a powerful demon within the golden doors of the edifice. For a time, peace returned to
the lands of Verbobonc.&nbsp;</p>
<p> The peace was short lived. The so-called "Second Rising" of the Horde of Elemental Evil surprised
no one. Viscount Wilfrick, alerted to the growing evil in the south, ordered the construction
of castle at the sleepy Village of Hommlet. In the late 570s, dozens of parties of adventurers sallied
forth against the temple. After much loss of life, the horde seemed at last to have
met defeat. The castle Hommlet was completed in 581 CY, and the folk of Verbobonc began cautiously to return to a
life unhindered by the shadow of evil.</p>
<p>Verbobonc was not an official participant of the Greyhawk Wars, though dozens
of volunteer companies native to the viscounty bolstered the armies of Furyondy and Veluna. Upon their
return, they found their homeland embroiled in a desperate political struggle with
the nations they had left to assist. In 585 CY, the Furyondian Knights of the Hart
called for the annexation of Verbobonc. Though representatives from Veluna sniffed at such talk, the
emergence of the Great Northern Crusade, in which Veluna and Furyondy acted as a single
political unit, frightened many in the town who had long preferred the reason (and liberal tax laws) of Mitrik to the zeal (and
active monitoring of the finances of the aristocracy) of Chendl. The situation came to a head when old
count Wilfrick died in his sleep in Harvester 587 CY, leaving Castle Grayfist to
his eldest known son, the Right Honorable Sir Fenward Lefthanded.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Though Viscount Fenward publicly denounced all talk of annexation, he also enacted a number of
policies that harmed the city and its allies. Since fall of the Temple of Elemental Evil and certain
well publicized raids into nonhuman lairs in the Gnarley forest (the success of which was overstated) "eradicated all enemies of
the viscounty, both imagined and otherwise," Viscount Fenward withdrew costly patrols from the forests and hills.
Nonhuman communities that depended on those patrols to protect them from real and still present threats
exploded in uproar against this new policy and an ill-thought insult Fenward aimed at the gnomes.
The gnomes the Kron Hills summarily declared themselves free from Verbobonc's authority, swearing
themselves only to their Clanlord, Unhgan the Eldest of Tulvar (LN male gnome Wiz7
(illusionist)/Ftr2), and to the Assembly of the Kron Hills, a council of gnome elders. The sylvan elves of the Gnarley, though
pressed without human patrols, scarcely acknowledged the change.</p>
<p>A series of slanderous dispatches between Viscount Fenward and the Kron Assembly followed left many city gnomes unsure of their
allegiance.&nbsp; This dangerous development ended only when papers implicating the viscount as an agent of the
Scarlet Brotherhood were discovered in Fenward's chambers. The papers were later revealed to be
forgeries, a fact that helped Fenward little, as he had slain by his captain of the guard when he
resisted imprisonment for treason.</p>
<p>Thereafter, rulership of Verbobonc fell to Langard of the Gnarley Border, a half-elven, half-forgotten son of Viscount Wilfrick.
By all reports, the new viscount was surprised to find himself in charge of the town,
and he is a cautious ruler.&nbsp; However, many look upon Langard's "discovery" with the
suspicion that he is a Scarlet Brotherhood agent and no relation to the former viscount. No less a personage
than the city's venerable Bishop Haufren (LN male human Clr14 of St. Cuthbert) vouches for him, however, so the skeptics have considerable
opposition to overcome.</p>
<p><br>
<b>Conflicts and Intrigues:</b> Several evil cults are thought to operate in this
region; cults of Vecna and Iuz are those most feared. The city's gnomes must allegiance between the viscounty and their
clans in the Kron Hills. Exiles from the Wild Coast have brought disease, drunkenness, and crime to the
region. The <i>Renvash Splinter</i>, a reliquary of the Cathedral of the Holy Cudgel, was recently stolen by
parties unknown.</p>

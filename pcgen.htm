  Installation</a> - This is a full version of PCGen, along with my data files,
  which include custom campaign stuff as well as WotC products no longer in
  current PCGen releases.&nbsp; This download is version 4.2.7, and contains
  everything you need.&nbsp; Just download and unzip.</p>
  <p align="left"><a href="http://bellsouthpwp.net/z/s/zshuford/zachs.zip">PCGen
  Data Files</a> - Alternately, if you are using a later version (there are no
  later versions as of this writing, but I doubt I'll update the full version
  above very often), you can download just my data files here.&nbsp; To use my data files, download and install PCGen as normal (the
  download site is <a href="http://pcgen.sourceforge.net">here</a>), and then
  download and unzip my file.&nbsp; You should see a folder called
  &quot;data.&quot;&nbsp; You need this folder <i>in addition to</i> the data
  folder that comes with the PCGen download.&nbsp; You need them both.&nbsp;
  Drop both data folders into the main PCGen folder. When you put the second one
  in, it'll ask you if you're sure you want to move it, that there is already a
  folder called data and that files with the same name will be
  overwritten.&nbsp; Say &quot;yes to all.&quot;&nbsp; And presto, you're
  golden.</p>

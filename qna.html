<p align="center"><b><font size="6">Questions and Answers</font></b>
<p align="center">&nbsp;
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q:&nbsp; What is this site?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A:&nbsp; Ah, that's an easy one.&nbsp; This site is
designed to be a resource for Planescape players in converting the Planescape
campaign setting to Third Edition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q:&nbsp; How often is it updated?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A:&nbsp; One per week.&nbsp; Usually.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q:&nbsp; What's a &quot;Kriegstanz?&quot;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A:&nbsp; The Kriegstanz is the undeclared war for the
hearts and minds of Sigil and the Outer Planes.&nbsp; It's mostly a political
one, fought with words and finances, but it sometimes spills over into
out-and-out bloodshed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q:&nbsp; Is this stuff balanced?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A:&nbsp; I think so.&nbsp; But to be honest, I haven't
playtested most of it.&nbsp; I think it's a bit more balanced than a lot of the
stuff you'll find on the Internet (or even some of the 3rd party companies), but
not as much so as, say, actual D&amp;D stuff published by WotC.&nbsp; I'm
looking for feedback, though, so if you think something is too powerful, let me
know.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q:&nbsp; Does joining a faction give me any special
benefits?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A:&nbsp; Not immediately, except the obvious benefits of
having a lot of new friends, belonging to a large organization, and other non-mechanic
stuff.&nbsp; However, joining a faction <i>does </i>give you access to faction
feats and prestige classes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q:&nbsp; In Second Edition, you got faction benefits for
free</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A:&nbsp; Well, this isn't second edition, now is it?&nbsp;
In Second Edition, you got all kinds of stuff for free in the form of kits,
factions, and whatnot.&nbsp; In Third, you have to spend something to get those
abilities, and the currency is feats and levels.&nbsp; That means you have to
take faction feats or prestige classes. However, if you really want, you may
instate an optional rule that allows characters to take one faction feat for
free when they join a faction.&nbsp; It should be noted that I don't endorse
this rule, however.&nbsp; It forsakes game balance to be more faithful to second
edition Planescape.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q:&nbsp; Feat X is too powerful!</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A:&nbsp; I don't believe it is.&nbsp; Some feats are
slightly better than their counterparts in the Core Rules, but like the regional
feats of Forgotten Realms these feats can be <i>slightly</i> more attractive due
being limited to only a small number of characters.&nbsp; However, if you really
think a feat is too powerful, email me at <a href="mailto:zach@zachshuford.com">zach@zachshuford.com</a>
and I'd be more than happy to discuss it. I'm looking for criticism after all,
and my primary concern is game balance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q:&nbsp; What happened to faction disadvantages?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A:&nbsp; Those are gone, for the most part.&nbsp; Since the
factions get nothing for free under my system, they don't get any special
hindrances either.&nbsp; And to be quite honest, the disadvantages in second
edition Planescape were often very arbitrary or nonsensical and were just there
in an attempt to balance the factions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some feats, however,
reintroduce certain hindrances, like the Transcendent Order's feat Action
Trance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q:&nbsp; Why doesn't X ability work the same as it did
in second edition?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A:&nbsp; Probably because my first goal is game balance and
my secondary goal is being faithful to second edition.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q:&nbsp; </b><b>Why do some factions have lots of stuff
on them and others don't?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A:&nbsp; Originally, I was doing whole factions at a time,
but I only got as far as the Dustmen, Harmonium, and the Godsmen before I got
burnt out.&nbsp; Now I'm just doing one update of some type per week.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q:&nbsp; Is there some way to find the new stuff quick?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A:&nbsp; Sure there is, just click on the &quot;New&quot;
link on the front page, it'll take you right to the new stuff.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q:&nbsp; </b><b>What happened to all the post-Faction
War stuff that used to be here.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A:&nbsp; Um, to be honest I don't think anyone was really
interested in it, so I ditched it.&nbsp; If you are interested, however, let me
know and I'll email it to you.&nbsp; ;)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Q:&nbsp; Do you accept submissions?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A:&nbsp; Sure, just email me at <a href="mailto:zach@zachshuford.com">zach@zachshuford.com</a>
and we'll work something out.&nbsp; I'd especially like some artwork, but I'm
really open to articles, prestige classes, or even just one new feat.<!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body>

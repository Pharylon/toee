<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">All things are divine, or so say the Believers of the
  Source.&nbsp; Life, indeed the entire cycle of lives that come from death and
  rebirth, is merely a test to unlock it.&nbsp; That's the whole point of it
  all.&nbsp; Everyone is being tested - primes, planars, even the powers
  themselves.&nbsp; If you succeed and come closer to the divine, then next life
  you'll be reincarnated as something higher up the scale.&nbsp; If you fail,
  you'll drop down.&nbsp; It's pretty simple.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The only problem is, no one's quite sure what the test <i>is.</i>&nbsp;
  Are you supposed to be kind or harsh?&nbsp; Generous or miserly?&nbsp; Good or
  Evil?&nbsp; The Godsmen are trying to figure it out, but no one's sure.&nbsp;
  But once you <i>do</i> figure it out, you become truly divine, and you become
  a power - a god - yourself.&nbsp; The
  Believers' last Factol, Curran, did just that, and is now a full-fledged power
  that grants spells to his clerics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"> Of course the test doesn't end there.&nbsp;
  Even once you get to the level of power, there are still challenges to
  overcome.&nbsp; Divinity is not the end of the test, but simply the next
  level.&nbsp; The Godsmen believe that even the
  powers can ascend to something greater, though that's so far above us mere
  mortals that no one has any clue what it is or what it
  involves.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">This ascension, the Godsmen say, is the ultimate goal of the
  multiverse.&nbsp; There are only a finite number of beings in the multiverse,
  and one day <i>everyone</i> will ascend.&nbsp; What happens then?&nbsp; The
  Godsmen say that the multiverse will simply end.&nbsp; It'll just fade out of
  existence without anyone left.&nbsp; And <i>then, </i>they say, everyone can
  get along with existence on a higher level of being.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">In Sigil, the Believers make their home in the Great Foundry,
  where metal is shaped and forged as they symbolically shape and forge their
  own souls.&nbsp; In the Outer Planes, the Godsmen's primary plane of influence
  is the Ethereal, where protomatter is molded into the multiverse, and where
  they believe the True Source exists, the source of all divinity.</p>

BARD</font></span></b></h4>
<h4><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:

 Luce was both a mathematician and a musician, who believed that all moments in
time had a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; font-weight: normal">unique
sound.&nbsp; While this sound, which he dubbed an &quot;empyrean
resonance,&quot; was too high to be heard, he believed they could transposed
down several octaves, so that mortal ears could hear them.&nbsp; In this way,
several moments of time could be strung together, creating music out of each
moment's resonance.&nbsp; The concept caught on like wildfire and quickly spread
throughout the Cage, as residents flocked to concerts where they would here the
empyrean melodies of a grand fountain, a busy street, or a great battle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p>In the last few years, a bard named Marician has taken empyrean melodies
further.&nbsp; After much training, meditation, and work on the complex
mathematics behind the melodies, he taught himself how to hear the melodies with
the naked ear, and studied them intensely.&nbsp; In time, he came to understand
that they not only reflected reality, but <i>affected</i> it as well.&nbsp; By
singing empyrean melodies transposed down to vocal range, he has learned to
change reality with his songs, and has gathered about him many young Godsmen
eager to learn his ways.&nbsp; Marician and his followers believe that empyrean
melodies are the source of reality, and perhaps a manifestation of the True
Source itself.&nbsp; Surely, by studying it, they can achieve the divinity so
sought after by all Godsmen.&nbsp;</p>

extra&nbsp; performance every level, just as normal Bards do.&nbsp; However,
using empyrean melodies, a bard can create musical effects far beyond that of
other bards.&nbsp; An <i>empyrean performance</i> counts as a bardic music use,
except they consume two uses of the ability, instead of one.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Moving Tune:&nbsp; </i>Thoughtful Rhythm is the most
basic of empyrean melodies.&nbsp; It can only subtly influence reality, changing
the mood of a situation.&nbsp; Those listening to a <i>Moving Tune</i> have
their attitudes adjusted one step in any direction in respect to any other
creature.&nbsp; He can affect a number of hitdice with this ability equal to his
ranks in perform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Metamagic Performance:&nbsp; </i>An Empyrean Bard may
weave empyrean melodies into the verbal components of the spells they cast.&nbsp;
This allows them to cast any spell as if he had any metamagic feat.&nbsp; The
bard must still cast the spell at a higher level, this ability only simulates
having the feat.&nbsp; <i>Metamagic Performance</i> counts as a number of <i>bardic
music</i> uses equal to twice the number of extra levels required by the
metamagic feat.&nbsp; For instance, Rogar, an Empyrean Bard, wishes to cast a
Empowered <i>Sleep </i>spell.&nbsp; Empower Spell requires that the spell be
cast in a slot two levels higher, so Rogar must cast <i>Sleep</i> as a third
level spell, and he uses up four <i>bardic music</i> uses.&nbsp; If a metamagic
feat does not cost <i>any</i> additional levels, it still uses up one <i>bardic
music</i> use.&nbsp; Spells affected by <i>Metamagic Performance</i> cannot be
cast silently - the Silent Spell feat cannot be used in conjunction with them
and are considered to have a verbal component, even if they did not before.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Song of What Is Not:&nbsp; </i>By singing empyrean
melodies of things that do not exist, an Empyrean Bard may fool others into
believing that they do.&nbsp; Singing a <i>Song of What Is Not</i> duplicates
the effects of a <i>Major Image</i> spell, as cast as a Sorcerer of Equal level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Skillful Composition:&nbsp; </i>By singing this empyrean
melody, and Empyrean Bard may substitute his perform skill for any other skill
on any one roll.&nbsp; When jumping, the music lifts him up into the air, when
concentrating it soothes his mind, ect.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Reality Allegro:</i>&nbsp; By singing a moment's
empyrean melodies faster than is natural, an Empyrean Bard can speed up time, at
least for him, giving him an extra standard action that round.&nbsp; <i>Reality
Allegro</i> is a free action.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Empty Chord:&nbsp; </i>By singing a <i>Empty Chord, </i>an
Empyrean Bard can interfere with the empyrean resonances of any creature or
object, dealing damage to it.&nbsp; When using <i>Empty Chord,</i> the Empyrean
Bard makes a Perform check and deals half the result of that check in damage to
any single target.&nbsp; If the target is a living creature, it is allowed a
Will save for half damage.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Song of What Is:&nbsp; </i>By singing empyrean melodies
of things that are not, he may bring them into existence.&nbsp; Singing a <i>Song
of What Is</i> duplicates the effect of a Major Creation Spell.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Healing Tune:&nbsp; </i>By singing this empyrean melody,
a bard may weave his own divine energy into the song of the moment, healing all
listeners a number of hitpoints equal to half their performance check.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Antimagic Song:&nbsp; </i>Magical effects have empyrean
melodies as well, and by disrupting these, an Empyrean Bard my duplicate the
effects of a <i>Dispel Magic</i>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Divine Melody:&nbsp; </i>The ultimate goal of any
Empyrean Bard is to unlock their own divinity through song.&nbsp; <i>Divine
Melody</i> allows them to cast any divine spell as if they were a cleric of
equal level.&nbsp; To do so, they must first make a perform check, the DC equal
to twice the level of the spell they wish to cast plus 10.&nbsp; This ability
costs a number of <i>bardic music</i> uses equal to twice the level of the spell
emulated.&nbsp; If they fail, their perform check, they still use up their <i>bardic
music</i> uses.&nbsp; Under no circumstances can they cast any spell of a level
higher than a cleric of equal level to their character level could cast.</p>

<p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><a name="ambar"><font color="#808000" size="4">Factol
Ambar Vergrove</font></a></span></b></p>
<p>Ambar's story is a sad one.&nbsp; Coming from a secluded part of the Outlands
called Fayrill, Ambar grew up in the wild.&nbsp; The elves of Fayrill, called
the Quybier, were unusually lawful and militant, and frowned upon
nonconformity.&nbsp; But Ambar's mother, a elfmaiden named Galina, was a
nonconformist through and through. For one thing she bore Ambar, whose father
was a human.&nbsp; When she didn't marry him, the Quybier elders were unsure
whether to be grateful or angry.&nbsp; They didn't enjoy the idea of having a
human among them, but neither did they approve of births out of wedlock.&nbsp;
But things got worse from there - Galina wouldn't fit in and shape herself to
the Quybier's stiff and formal traditions.&nbsp; Instead, she seemed to spend
all her time laughing, singing, dancing, and playing the harp, activities that
would be quite normal among most elves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually, the Quybier elders just gave up on ever getting her to conform,
and exiled her so that her disruptive behavior wouldn't spread to the rest of
the Quybier.&nbsp; So Galina took her child and began a life in the
forest.&nbsp; Fayrill had long been a haven for elves, and the landscape seemed
designed to live in, full of trees whose branches provided excellent shelter,
wild berries and fruits to eat, and soft moss to sleep on.&nbsp; Indeed, the
Quybier's legends say that it was once part of the Seelie Court, but became
detached from that realm as the Quybier became more and more lawful.&nbsp;
Whatever the truth, Galina had no trouble surviving, and Ambar was raised
drinking clear spring water, eating luscious fruits, and sleeping under the
stars.</p>
<p>He was content for many years, until he spied a group of Quybier straying
through his wood.&nbsp; That was when he saw the elfmaiden Caye, and Ambar fell
in love.&nbsp; He asked Caye's father, Florien, for her hand, but was harshly
refused.&nbsp; Ambar didn't understand why - in his sheltered existence, he
didn't know that he was considered poor by others.&nbsp; To him, he lived in a
palace.&nbsp; Still, Florien's refusal didn't stop Ambar.&nbsp; Instead, he
secretly wooed Caye without her father's knowledge, and eventually she came to
live with him in the forest.</p>
<p>Caye, Ambar, and his mother all lived happily for a few years, and eventually
Caye became pregnant.&nbsp; But before she could bear Ambar a child, her father
caught back up with her.&nbsp; He was a powerful man, and has sent troops to
track the couple down and return Caye to him.&nbsp; What he hadn't really
expected was that Caye would fight back.&nbsp; In the ensuing scuffle, both Caye
and Galina were killed, and Ambar was brought in chains before Florien.&nbsp; Accused
of kidnapping Caye, Ambar replied, <font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" SIZE="3">&quot;I
accuse <i>you!&nbsp; </i>I accuse you, murderer of my mother, slayer of my
consort and unborn child!&nbsp; I accuse you of killing my happiness, of</font> <font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" SIZE="3">defiling
my home, and robbing me of my</font> <font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" SIZE="3">future.
Dare you deny me? Dare you demand recompense in the face of that which</font> <font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" SIZE="3">you
owe me?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT" size="3">Florien had never meant for Caye to
die, and was shamed by Ambar so greatly that he gave Ambar a casket filled with
gems and begged him to depart forever.&nbsp; Ambar, with nothing left to loose,
took the gems and complied.&nbsp; Over the next several years, Ambar
prospered.&nbsp; His wood-lore was great, and he invested his fortune in gems
wisely.</font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT" size="3">He searched the Great Ring for a new
home, and eventually he found one with the Believers of the Source, whose
approach to life seemed to compliment his own.&nbsp; His mellow, calm, and above
all friendly demeanor (he still has everyone call him by his first name) earned
him plenty of friends within the faction, and he seemed to gravitate toward leadership
positions within the Believers until he became Factol.&nbsp; He's extremely
popular within his faction (although outside of it, many others find him a bit
of a bore) and half of the faction would lay down their lives for him, though
Ambar never asks this of anyone.&nbsp; He values lives more than he does
philosophies - a rare trait among the factols.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT" size="3"><i>Tactics</i>:&nbsp; The following
  represents Ambar's normal gear - if he was expecting trouble he could outfit
  himself with nearly any non-artifact in the DMG.&nbsp; Should he be ambushed
  unexpectedly, he will generally cast <i>Haste</i> on himself and either
  attempt to escape if the odds look bad or fight if the odds look good (using
  his full round action to attack, and his hasted partial action to cast buff
  spells on himself).&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

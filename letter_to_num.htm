<p>Dear Son___________________</p>

<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">I am writing this so you will
know a little about the town Hishn and about me.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I hope one day you will return to Hishn and visit me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What I am doing and what I have to do are both a monumental sacrifice and
a monumental joy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The complexity of the matter you will certainly never
completely grasp but I have to try and explain to you as best I can the why and
how of the situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First let me
begin with Hishn.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Hishn is an Elven town that came into existence about 500 years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But older than the town is a temple to Rao.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact when Hishn was first beginning to take shape as a struggling
“outpost” the temple of Rao already existed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The town Hishn grew around the temple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The temple of Rao is cared for by the only humans living in Hishn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact the descendents of the human family have always cared for the
temple of Rao and by their accounts the temple has stood since 2CY.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The family is rarely seen in Hishn since the affairs they deal in take
place within the gray temple walls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
have spoken with the current patriarch of the temple of Rao, the place is their
home as much as it is a temple, and he tells me his sons’ like all other males
in his family go out to seek fortune and a wife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then the young men return to the temple of Rao in order to upkeep it and
worship Rao.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current Patriarch
is called Olen and I doubt he will be alive, since he is 66 now, when and if I
see you again after you leave me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Olen
has 3 sons to take over as Patriarch of the temple of Rao so the line runs
strong to this day.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The son’s names are Nethaniel, Nicolbolas and Noah.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Nethaniel I have met and he likes to be called Neth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He is 14 for a human that is getting close to grown. Neth is growing into
a man with values and morals similar if not identical to his father Olen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nicolbolas is 20 and Noah is nearing 30 though I am unclear as to how old
he is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have never actually seen
Noah though his brother Neth and the wife of Olen speak of him to me when I
visit the temple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why am I writing
you this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why should you care about
the temple of Rao?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After all he is
a god of humans…<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Rao is the god your brother has
chose though he is an Elf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I visit
the temple<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Once every week to feel closer to my
son in his absence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Numenarh
Daerkwood is my firstborn child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
is tall for an Elf, except for his father whom is the same height, and the
tallest in Hishn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Numenarh is good
hearted and careful with words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Numenarh
judges people slowly and carefully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
Numenarh to call someone friend is not to be taken lightly and from what I know
of these days calling him enemy is to be taken soberly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Numenarh is an adventurer and a risk-taker.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You could call him the hero of the family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Perenthace is young and is your brother as well…<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Perenthace will always be young and childlike but none the less the boy
knows things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perenthace has been
given the gift of prophecy by what hand or fate I do not know. In fact
Perenthace told me that you would be a <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">boy</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I take Perenthace at his word and so call you son.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have never known Perenthace to be wrong about such things as he tells
me will happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some things are
mundane and others important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes
he says enigmatic things that I don’t understand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Just the other day he said: “Numenarh is red and in Harmony with a big
“H” and he grows close to thought and action, word and deed.”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I have no idea what that means but I write it here because is
shows the way Perenthace relates to the world.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Now something about me: Marahnaiol is my name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My childhood name was Lia and before I became a Daerkwood my family name
was Holimion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Holimion means
Diamonddew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At age 90 I declared
myself Marahnaiol and 2 years later I married your father.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When I was 50 I began to realize I had special gifts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have an inborn talent for magic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
am a sorcerer and not only that I have psionic talents as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I developed the abilities of sorcerer innately but the psionic talents
were less easy to control and to harness though both come naturally to me I
suppose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am 214 years old and
soon to be 215.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That must seem old
to you but it isn’t so much for an Elven person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I love apples and a chance meeting in the Vesve caused me to meet your
father…<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I was traveling and seeing the world when I grew hungry and I noticed I
was coming into a place where majestic apple trees lined the forest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After picking some I was confronted by your father who told me that I was
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Stealing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I asked how I could be stealing when these apples were in The Vesve and
free for everyone?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well I got my
answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About 150 years ago the
family your father belongs to was granted a fife of land in the Vesve and so
they grew apples and were owners of an orchard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This made your family a generous living.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Recently though a fire swept through the Vesve and the
orchard your family had was utterly destroyed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But your father is well to do and a seasoned adventurer and Wizard so you
will want for nothing as you grow up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
ever your father should meet hardship he knows he can count on me to assist in
all the ways that I can…but do not concern yourself with these things because
your life will be filled with plenty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
don’t know how old you will be when you begin reading this but I asked your
father to let you begin at age 12 and sooner if you have too many questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I don’t have much more time to write just now as I have a lecture to
give at The School of Tal concerning some ancient text I have been translating
as of late.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wanted this to be,
what I write you, a kind of unfolding story and so read as much or as little as
you like as it goes along.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I will
divide it into Chapters beginning with most obviously this as Chapter 1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I know I have not explained much but I not only write you in my
spare-time but also in secret.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do
not worry all will be explained in due time as these pages unfold.<o:p>
</o:p>

</span>Until I write you again dear son________Marahnaiol<o:p>

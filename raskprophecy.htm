<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Rask's Prophecy</font></b></p>
<p>In the common year of 91, there shall be born an elf with hate and malice in
his heart and veins.&nbsp; Shunned by the elven community, he shall take to the
wild, and learn the ways of the barbarians so that he may wreak havoc and
revenge on those whom he believed wronged him.&nbsp; For Four Hundred Years,
none would best him in battle, but the day will come when battle would not be
enough for him.&nbsp; Seeking more, he shall call upon Nerull for help and loose
his life in the dark arts so that he may gain unlife and feed on the
living.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On that night there will be born a human whose gift in fighting the undead
will be mighty.&nbsp; He shall grow and learn ways of fighting undeath that few,
if any, have before.&nbsp; In time, the Elf will learn of this, and try to stop
the Man, and so they are destined to battle, though only one is destined to
survive.</p>
<p>This is what I see.&nbsp; This is the future.</p>

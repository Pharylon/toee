<p class=MsoNormal><b>Overview:</b> The war-ravaged lands between the Griff
Mountains and the Artonsamay River, north of the Yol, hold the remains of the
former duchy of Tenh. The Greyhawk Wars that destroyed this country have not
yet ended here; Tenh, the first victim of the wars, seems destined to be its
last. Duke Ehyeh III, scion of an ancient Flan lineage, attempts to reclaim his
homeland with meager assistance from the County of Urnst. He has other
supporters, of course, including the mage Nystul of the Circle of Eight, but
few followers, troops, and resources are available to him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His once great reputation as a leader was
destroyed along with his nation, leaving him little more noble title and
moderate riches. The duke has not set foot on his native soil in nearly a
decade, a fact that is reflected in the uncertain morale of his troops in Tenh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Palish have a much stronger force in Tenh, in the form
of a zealot army. Many Tenh exiles were converted over time to the worship of
Pholtus, practiced in the Pale, and organized into an army known as the
Faithful Flan. A fighting force utterly loyal to the theocrat, two contingents
of the &quot;Faithful Flan&quot; have crossed the Yol into Tenh. The larger
contingent entered at Athersrone, which they now occupy, and the smaller passed
through the Phostwood. Some of Duke Ehyeh's troops have defected to the
Faithful Flan, who are better fed and supplied in addition to having a larger
army.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two former allies, Iuz and the Fists of Stonehold are now at
each other's throat. The Fists occupy strong defensive position in the cities
of Nevond Nevnend and Calbut across the Zumkend River guarding Rockegg Pass
through the Griffs against all other groups in Tenh. Iuz has sent troops across
the Zumkend River from the town of Rookroost in the Bandit Kingdoms (to the
south), in an attempt to occupy the abandoned territories. Currently, the
forces loyal to Duke Ehyeh hold Redspan, where they are supplied via the
Artonsamay River. The Palish armies control southern and eastern Tenh, from the
edge of the Phostwood to the town of Oxton, making frequent attack on the
troops of Iuz that move through the no-man’s land of central Tenh. Iuz controls
both banks of the Zumker to within sight of Nevond Nevnend, though his soldiers
avoid coming within bowshot of the city's walls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>History:</b> The fertile uplands between the Artonsamay
River and the Griff Mountains provided a homeland to the Flan since before the
Great Migrations, more than one thousand years past. The diverse groups of Flan
who found shelter here learned new methods of warfare during their early
conflicts with the Oerid and Suel invaders of the Flanaess. They organized their
armies, and later the state, on the Oeridian model, forming the duchy of Tenh
in the early years of Aerdi expansion in the eastern Flanaess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The duchy joined in a short-lived alliance with the Nyrondal
princes until the Battle of a Fortnight Length. In the wake of that defeat, the
duke of Tenh pledged fealty to the king of Aerdy, giving the monarch authority
over the duke and his personal holdings in Tenh and the Coltens. Neither the
Convocation of Knights and Marshals, nor any of the other nobles or landholders,
ever endorsed the duke's pledge. They considered Tenh to be an independent
realm, though they chose not to resist the Great Kingdom's claim on the field
of battle, effectively bowing to Aerdy for over four centuries. Eventually, the
Great Kingdom showed signs of decay. When the Nyrondal princes declared the end
of their allegiance to the overking, the duke was persuaded to follow suit. The
Battle of Redspan signaled the end of the duke's fealty to the overking of
Aerdy. The Aerdy force was routed by the Tenh cavalry and pushed down the
&quot;Red Road to Rift Canyon&quot; in an action made famous in the ballad of
the same name. The army of the Great Kingdom was not actually swept into the
Rift Canyon, as the ballad proclaims, but they were so thoroughly defeated that
many of the Aerdi officers and soldiers chose exile in the Bandit Kingdoms over
the punishments awaiting them at home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tenh's independence brought with it renewed challenges. The
Bandit Kings across the Artonsamay and Zumker rivers pushed at the duchy's
western borders, while the newly formed Theocracy of Pale threatened their
eastern border.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Rovers of the
Barrens continued to raid, as always and with greater effectiveness after their
encounters with the Baklunish nomads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The duchy maintained its sovereignty in all its holdings until the rise
of the outlaw Rover called Stonefist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This infamous warrior was a menace throughout the region for several
years,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>finally choosing to build a
settlement on the border of the Coltens Feodality. The Coltens were still
vassals of the duke of Tenh, though their atamans had grear latitude in
determining their own affairs. The leaders of the Coltens were deceived and
murdered by Stonefist under the guise of a parlay. The forces of Tenh, which
had never been strong in the region, were unable to dislodge him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Hold of Stonefist remained a threat to Tenh for more
than a century, and ultimately brought about its destruction. The first action
of the Greyhawk Wars was an invasion of war bands from Stonehold, though this
was unlike any previous attack. The Fists had new tactics, and demonic
assistance, that overwhelmed the defenses of the city of Calbut, and soon
thereafter, Nevond Nevnend. Had the duke been in the city at the time, perhaps
he could have rallied his troops to stand; as it was, both citizens and
soldiers gave way to panic--though in hindsight, many have suggested that this
was demonically inspired fear. The duke and his family fled to the County of
Urnst, leaving their nation to the Stoneholders, and the clerics and the
clerics and demons of Iuz.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For six years after the invasion, the Stoneholders held the
Tenha enslaved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The evil of Iuz was
present throughout the land as well, though never in plain sight.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Perhaps this state of affairs would have
persisted indefinitely had not an unnatural rage come upon the rhelt of
Stonehold, during a meeting in the ruins of the duke's palace at Nevond
Nevnend. In an astonishing turn of loyalty, he gave the command to put the
clerics and agents of Iuz to the sword, also letting his warriors murder Tenha
slaves out of hand. The Fists then withdrew from all but the northernmost part of
Tenh, which they still hold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Armies from the Pale and forces loyal to the exiled duke
quickly crossed the borders, battling each other for possession of the southern
and eastern regions of the duchy, including the Phostwood. The duke's forces
fought a hard battle against bandits and surviving agents of Iuz in the city of
Redspan, gaining the aid of Nystul of the Circle of Eight. They now control all
of the old city. Its famous bridge has not yet been rebuilt, but its walls are
restored, and it provides a strong base for further action in the duchy.
Redspan's weak spot is its often-raided supply line, leading back to the County
of Urnst along the east bank of the Artonsamay River.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Conflicts and Intrigues:</b> Savage fighting rages in
central Tenh and the Phostwood. Raiders from Stoink and Dimre cross into
western Tenh at will. Palish soldiers threaten to besiege the duke's forces in
Redspan, but trolls are attadting Palish strongholds in eastern Tenh,
disrupting their supply lines.</p>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Hi, I'm Mewn Riverflow.  How are you?  Thought I might introduce myself to me again since I have not written in this darned thing in so long.  I'm from the city of Verbobonc.  Well, not originally.  I don't remember where I�m from originally.  I just remember my parents' faces, mostly.  I think they were killed or something, 'cause I don't think I was just abandoned.  Hey, I was a cute kid!  I was only twenty at the time, anyway.  Verbobonc is where I learned to live by the "shadowy arts".   Yeah, I'm a rogue, so what?<br> 

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>OK, now that's out of the way, High-low time.  My low was that I was just about caught again today trying to pick a pocket at an inn in Oakhurst.  If it weren't for my quick thinking of planting that purse on someone else I would have been.  If only I could have placed it on one of those guys, which brings me to my high.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>My high today was meeting a group of guys sitting at a table.  One was an elf like me; his name was Numenarh Daerkwood.  I think that he�s a ranger or something.  You can tell just by looking at him that he has NO sense of humor.  Guess that it has to do with the life he chose.  He told me that he left home because he didn't like being made to go to the wizard school that his father taught at.  Personally, I don't think he realizes how lucky he is to even have a family.  I wish that I still HAD my parents.  There was a weird sounding dwarf, too, named Quadro Gemeni.  He's a wizard, if you can believe that.  That makes this the first time I have ever met a dwarven wizard.  Something a little off about him, a little too friendly.  The human's name is Rask "the destroyer of evil", he's kind of weird for a cleric of Ole' Saint Cuthbert.  No idea what his last name is, can't call him Mr. The Destroyer of Evil.  Well, I could, but that would be too easy.  Besides, something!
 tells me that he just wouldn't get it.  They had another member of their group that left them, a dwarven fighter named Barkin Leatherhand.  They said that he used a chain with spikes or something.  They also told me that there is a bard named Julin Sander in their group.  He was not feeling well and was being cared for at the temple, so I did not get to meet him.  Rat bite or something.  I take it that Julin is at the temple of Saint Cuthbert, the one Rask is from.  Oh! I almost forgot their pet, Meepo.  Meepo would be just adorable if he wasn't so darn ugly. Speaks common fairly well for a kobold.  The little thing seems to be partial to Quadro.  Don't ask � I didn't.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>They asked me to go along with them after they found out that I could be of great use to them.  Well, it's free room and board, and I think that Numenarh will be a hoot to mess with.  Besides, it's a way to get out of this town before things get a little too hot around here.  Well, next time I will tell you what happened tomorrow, and how it all went.  Until then, chin up, hold your head high, and watch everyone be amazed!</font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, today started out well enough.  At least breakfast and the travel here were nice.  During our way to this place that these people call The Sunless Citadel (yeah, scary, huh?), these guys told me not to attack kobolds. (Yeah, right!) Nume told me that we were actually helping some kobolds get rid of some pesky goblins � wait let me back up.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>To hear it from them, they were there to find some adventurers that never returned.  I know Nume said there was a paladin, a wizard, a ranger� well you get the idea.  While looking for them they found Meepo crying about a lost baby dragon named Calcryx (oh, wait. It gets even better).  Quadro volunteered the group to help find this little dragon.  Meepo, being really excited by this, took them to be introduced to their queen; she�s a kobold sorceress.  She asked them to help with the goblins that were trying to run them out of their home.  They would not tell me who said yes, though I have a good idea.  Well, they had a few fights and found out that they did not have enough food on them.  Needless to say, they came back to town.  That was when that Barkin guy decided to stay out of the adventuring life.  Enter me!<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I get here and, yes, it's dirty. It's damp.  It's just not a nice place.  No rats, though.  That's good.  So here I am wondering where all the trouble is that they need MY help.  Then it happens, a fight.  Four goblins behind a small wall with caltrops lying all over the floor.  Hopeless, you say?  No way!  I show my uncanny ability at using a bow for anything but what it used for!  I push the caltrops aside by pushing the bow along the floor. Someone told Meepo to use his short spear to get the rest out of the way.  I climbed the wall and got down on the other side to attack them, only they were dead already.  Numenarh shot most of them and Quadro used his magic.  You can imagine how I felt.  Well, next fight then. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, not exactly.  The next fight I was able to show off my sneakiness to find out about five goblins behind the same kind of small wall.  Again I show how inept I am at firing a bow.  So I drop the darned thing and run toward the wall while drawing my sword.  I go to jump the wall and fell on my ass.  Not just once, either.  I did it twice!  Yeah, call me Grace.  Again, before I get to attack any goblins, Numenarh and the others had taken them all out.  Yea, me.<br> 

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As it turns out, all I had to do was just get use to fighting along side these guys.  And just as soon as that started to happen, I got hurt really bad.  I can't remember how I got hurt, but I do know that I was scared that I was going to die as I passed out.  Then this incredible warmth flowed through me.  When I opened my eyes I saw Mr. Destroyer of Evil smiling down at me, asking me if I was all right.  He had done his cleric thingy on me and healed me.  Wow, he saved my life.  Me!  Looking back, that was pretty incredible!<br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Anyway, we run into a few fights here and there with more goblins.  Me with the getting use to the whole group thing.  Uh� I mean� Darn it!  Fighting!  You know, along SIDE these guys!  Not � oh never mind. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We then found that little dragon that Meepo was so hyped on finding.  Only when we found it, it didn't want to go.  It attacked Meepo, then Quadro.  So here we were trying to get this little white dragon out from under a table.  Just then, out from this little thing came this blast of cold.  Luckily, it didn't hit me.  With everyone worried about killing this thing and unable to get to it, I pulled out my sap and climbed under the table to knock it out.  Then it blasted ME with that breath of cold it has.  Quadro said that it was scared of going back into a cage, and that was how the negotiations began with a baby white dragon.  So now a baby dragon sees me as a steed for it to ride.  Thank you very much, Quadro.<br> 

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I hate that dragon.  I hate it.  Hate it.  Hate it!  If it breathes on me one more time with that cold, I swear I'll yank it off my shoulder by its neck and beat it into unconsciousness with my sap!  Luckily, we left it in the room we found it in. We fully intended on coming back later to collect him.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Just after that, though, we found a gnome guy named Erky that was being held prisoner in a small cage in a room with two kobolds, they were chained to a spike.  That was were we found out that the people we were looking for had been captured and had been held here for some time.  As a matter of fact, about a week before, they were taken from the room Erky was in and had not been seen since.  After getting Erky out of that cage, we decided to rest.  That was until we heard a commotion in one of the other rooms.  Numenarh went to check it out from one way while the rest of us would go another way. Yeah RIGHT, like I was going to let him get into a fight alone.  So, me with me being the super klutz that likes to think she can sneak around unheard, alerted the goblins that we were there.  Yeah, a fight broke out because of my incompetent skills as a rogue.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, despite my actions we won.  Well, sort of.  You see, one of them got away and alerted the other goblins of our presence.  Suddenly, we all got this great idea of questioning some of the goblins we had prisoner and decided to act on that information they were way eager to spill.  Found out some good juicy info, too.  Come to find out there was a hobgoblin chieftain leading these goblins in attacking the kobolds for dominance of this place to call their own.  As far as I'm concerned they both could have at it and kill each other off.  Alas, we couldn�t do that.  We had to find those lost guys, or at least report what happened to them. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Remember that little goblin that got away?  Well, he alerted the other goblins all right.  They had barricaded the doors and everything.  Bursting our way in, we found nothing but a lot of scared goblin mommas and their little goblin babies.  NO!  We didn't kill them!  What are you insane?  We found more barricaded doors.  Yep, we burst those in, too.  Right into a whole slew of goblins and some big hobgoblins.  Man that was a hard fought battle.  Meepo, Erky and Rask all three went down. Rask came the closest to dying.  I thought that he HAD died with the wound he had.  Guts were hanging out and everything.  EW!  Only I saw that he was breathing, albeit very shallow breathing.   Luckily, I was able to feed him some of those healing potions he got from that temple of his.  Yeah, after all of that, we decided it was time to rest a bit.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>While everyone was resting, though, I took it upon myself to get some answers from one of the goblin females.   Turns out that those guys we are suppose to find, were thought to be dead.  The chieftain killed one, definitely, and the last two were thrown down into a hole they called the Twilight Grove where a druid named Belek lived, and he supposedly had this tree called the Galthias Tree (whatever that was).  Well, I decide to tie a rope around that goblin and lower it into the pit so it can tell me what was all in there.  Hey, I was careful!  After bring her back up she told me that there were two skeletons walking around taking care of a garden.  Now that is just damned WRONG!<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Needless to say, I survived long enough to write all of this down so I can read it later and laugh.  I can honestly say this, though.  These guys are not dull. Maybe I will stick around.  Until tomorrow, chin up, hold your head high, and watch everyone be amazed! (Whether at how good or how bad you are) =^_^=</font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, today was rather difficult.  Not only did I finally get to meet the Julin fellow that was sick from that rat bite, but also the fight with the druid did not bode well for me.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today started out with us getting ready to climb down the hole where the two skeletons were.  As we were getting ready, Numenarh started telling how we were not going to have much of a problem with the skeletons because of Rask.  He told me that Rask had turned several undead into dust. I think that he said about four zombies or something like that.  Yeah, I thought that it was impressive, too.  Just obliterating undead like it was nothing.  Rask started to say something about it when I heard this voice I had not heard before agreeing with Nume about what Rask could do with the undead. When I turned around, I saw this rather beautiful man standing at the doorway.  His hair was black and curly.  A little on the frail side for a human, even for an elf for that matter.  But he was really pretty.  I can�t believe how flustered I was when I was introduced to him.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After the evident pleasantries were out of the way, Julin announced that we were going down into the hole.  I thought that it was a little pompous to just come out of the blue like that and tell what we were going to do even when it was evident that we were going to do that very thing in the first place.  No one else seemed to mind so I let it go.<br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>So, we climb down.  Well, Rask tried and almost fell.  I can�t fault him though, after all not everyone can be as graceful as me.  The rest of us made it fairly well.  The lower we got, the more an eerie greenish glow began to illuminate all around us.  We found, upon reaching the bottom of the pit, that it was actually a cavern with a thick moss floor, and little sapling trees everywhere; the two skeletons were tending to them.  As soon as we were all down, Julin started to sing.  Man, can that guy sing!  I don�t know why, but when he started to sing I felt more confident and less worried.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Then, just like it was nothing, Rask walked right up to those skeletons to turn them into dust.  Man, was I excited.  I would finally get to see this miraculous power that he had.  He confidently raised a large symbol, that he had hanging around his neck, with his right hand, started chanting aloud and POOF!  Nothing.   All he did was piss them off.  They just looked at him and attacked.   So here we were, frantically getting the skeletons off of Rask.   Nume stabbed at one, while Julin fired a crossbow bolt at the other one, both seemingly doing nothing.  Seeing that both swords and arrows seem to do nothing to these skeletons, I pulled out a small mace I was luckily carrying and proceeded in bashing at them.  Well, as it turns out, maces work really well against skeletons.  Just as I smash one of the skeleton�s head to bits, someone yells out that we are being surrounded by these little tree monsters.  We got through the fight fairly unharmed except for poor Meepo, !
he got hurt pretty badly.  Not to worry though, Rask did the healy thing on him.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, time pasted and we went through some stone worked tunnels.  I guess you could call them tunnels.  Anyway, we found several empty rooms.  Except for one, that is.  We entered it just like all the others; with us convincing Julin that just busting in the door was a bad idea.  We entered the room quietly. It was pretty much empty except for this large alter to some dragon.  I was told by Julin to search it for traps.  A little annoyed, I did.  As soon as I started looking though, this shadowy hand shot out and grabbed my arm.  I don�t know what happened to me, but I felt as if my strength was slipping away.  I scrambled away from it as fast as I could.  That was when Rask stepped forward and tried his turning to dust thing again.  Only this time it screamed and run away from Rask as if it were terrified of him.  I would have started laughing if I had not gotten hurt.  Looking back now though it was pretty funny.  I wonder if Rask can scare other peoples� shadows li!
ke that, too.  Now that WOULD be funny.  Well, after that shadow thingy ran away I was able to search the dragon alter for traps.  I found no traps, although I did find a hidden compartment with two vials in it.   I opened one to see if I could figure out what sort of potion was inside it.  To my dismay, I got burned by what Quadro identified as something called Alchemist Fire.  Luckily, I didn�t get burned badly.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After giving the alchemist fire to Quadro to carry, I noticed Julin pocketing one of the jewel eyes from the dragon alter.  I offered to Julin my services on appraising the gem for him.  He accepted and threw me the gem. But while I was examining the gem I also noticed him pocketing the other gem.  When I questioned his actions, Numenarh heard me and came over to see what was going on.  After I told Nume what was going on, that was when Julin called me a bitch.  First, I was stunned and could do nothing but blink at him.  Next, I was mortified the he would call me such a name.  I looked at Numenarh for understanding; he had no answers.   Now, I am hurt am angry.   I do not know what his problem is, but he will pay for that insult.  I know not how or even when.   But what goes around comes around.  Life has a way of fixing things.  He no long even looks pretty to me.  Goes to show that you cannot judge a book by its cover.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Anyway, to make a long story short, we found the druid and one of his goblins along with the two adventures we were trying to find.   They were standing around this huge tree (yep, you guessed it, the Galthias Tree).  We snuck up to these nice size walls and hid behind them in order to listen in on them.  I whispered to Quadro that we could use the two vials of alchemist fire on the tree.  I watched him tell Nume the idea I had but Numenarh shook his head no.  Now that I look back on it, I understand what he was thinking. All the vegetation could burst into flames and kill us all.   We heard the druid threaten the goblin�s life if he did not go and look for us.  Heck I would be scared of us, too, if I were him.  Julin and I heard the goblin coming our way, so we his in the shadows.  I noticed that it was headed toward the rest of the group and knew that it would see Rask or Quadro, so I jumped out and attacked the goblin with my incredible ability to give away our pos!
ition.  Yeah, I missed.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Before everyone could react to my blunder, the paladin guy rushed me and attacked.  Man did he move fast!  I only had time to notice that his face looked like severely tanned leather.  The next thing I knew, his sword was shattering my longsword.  My favorite sword!  I just knew that I was done for.  I mean, I couldn�t defend myself at all.  I think that the only reason he didn�t finish me off was that Numenarh distracted him, giving me time to draw my longbow.  After that, everything was pretty much a blur for me.   I was concentrating on using my bow against the druid in hopes that if I killed him that the paladin and the wizardess would no longer be under the druid�s control.  Sometime in the battle I saw Numenarh stand between us and the druid, saying that we should maybe hear what the druid was saying.  Yeah, right!  Later we found out that the wizardess had used a spell to charm Numenarh.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Just then, the druid did something to make all the plants at our feet try and grab hold of us.   Luckily, I was able to not get caught.  I don�t remember who all got stuck; all I remember was how angry I got that they were using my friend against us.  Maybe anger is the key to using a bow, because I hit that druid with several shots from that longbow.  I know that I hurt him pretty bad, for I saw how angry he looked at me.   He started waving his hands around.  I seem to remember someone behind me yell out in pain, and then I felt it.  A fiery ball had hit me from behind while I was advancing on the druid.  The last thing I remember was incredible pain, wishing to die to make it stop hurting, and then blackness.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I awoke to Numenarh and Rask kneeling over me, and the fight over.  Even though they we smiling at me, I could see the worry in their eyes.  That was when I knew just how close I came to dying.  Nume told me that he saved my life twice, once by wrapping my wounds to stop the bleeding and by feeding me a quarter of one of those golden apples.  Oh and he said that Rask helped a little.  Good ole Numenarh seems to have a SMALL sense of humor at least.  Maybe I am not cut out for this sort of life.  The thought of dying is not appealing at all to me.  I don�t even know if my parents are already dead to meet me on the other side or not.  No, this won�t do.  I have to be more careful.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Seeing that the guys had tied up the druid, it was suggested that we question him about the Galthias Tree.  So we woke him up and found out that someone killed a vampire named Galthias with a stake to the heart, then buried him in this cavern where the stake grew into the Galthias Tree.  When asked about the golden apples, he told us about how it produces golden apples that heal in one season, but silver apples that kill in the opposing season.  Talk about freaky.  I am really starting to get the feeling that I am getting in this over my head.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>At least, here I sit again. Writing in this journal during my portion of the watch.  I am glad no one has found out that I do this.  They might get mad that I am not being more attentive.  Yeah, I know.  Part of me agrees with them.  But this is really the only time I get to do this.  But, I guess I will stop here.   Until next time if I survive.  Always remember to keep your chin up, hold your head high, and watch everyone be amazed (even if it is that everyone survived the day).</font><font size="6">

Sunday, The Thirteenth Day of Flocktime, 591cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

</font><p align="left"> 

<font face="Monotype Corsiva"> 

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, I can say for sure know that almost dying sucks.   Man, I woke up sore!  Good thing Rask has that healing thing he can do.   I can say this for Rask; he is a generous soul to keep healing everyone like he does.  He has to love what he does.  I think that he is one of the nicer humans I have met.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Just as I was looking forward to going back to town and get a room at the inn so I could take a long overdue bath, Julin convinced everyone that we needed to go and find out what was hidden behind some door.  So needless to say, we went.  It was a horrible mistake, I thought.  Main reason was that Rask had said he used all of the spells his deity allowed him to have, or something like that. I have never understood that sort of thing.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>All of the rooms behind that door were fairly nondescript.  Then, we came to a pit with spikes.  Julin, Mr. I am everything, decided that he could jump it.  Well, he didn�t make it.  Rask tried after Julin and made it to the other side.  Just as I was trying to jump across, I was distracted by something behind Rask and fell into the pit myself.  Luckily, I didn�t get hurt to badly.   Julin was no worse for wear either.  Then I heard the commotion above us.  Whatever I saw behind Rask was now attacking him.  Both Julin and I tried to get up there to help him as best we could.  The others were thankfully able to help Rask to defeat something called a quasit that was put there to guard what was behind the next door.  Naturally, we had to find out what.  So we entered and found a sarcophagus which I immediately did not like finding.  I cannot remember who opened it but we found out what the quasit was guarding.  As it turned out the quasit wasn�t to keep others out.  It w!
as to keep something in.  That something turned out to be a creature called a troll.  I had heard stories about trolls from adventurers that came to the brothel that I often hid out at in Vurbobonc.  Trolls here big, ugly, mean, and pretty much unkillable in the always coming back sort of way.  We immediately surrounded it and started to attack it.  Yep, those men back at the brothel were right.  But they left out smelly.  We were taking a pretty bad beating.  Then Numenarh went down.  I saw Rask go to tend Nume�s wounds, while the rest of us attended to the troll.  We just about did not make it.  After we felled the troll, I remembered what those guys at the brothel said about trolls coming back. So I proceeded to hacking at it with the longsword that we got from the dead paladin until I was satisfied that it would not come back for a long while.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Finally we got to go home and sell some of this cool stuff we found.  After everything was divided up equally I was able to get some new stuff for myself.  I went to that dwarf guy named Barkin, partly out of curiosity but mostly because the guys told me that he would give our group some great deals.  I think that it was because they felt sorry for him.   But hey, who am I to judge. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Man I was able to get some great stuff.  I got a new longsword that Barkin said was one of his boss�s best swords.  Same thing with a dagger that I bought and the suit of studded leather.  I have a horse now! I have always wanted a horse.  He�s beautiful and very well mannered.  I got some other nice things, too.  Maybe the adventuring life does have its advantages.   So, here I am yet again writing in my journal.  Only this time after taking a long nice bath and in a room of my own.  I still can feel the nastiness of the place, but not so much.  A few more baths and I will surely be feeling normal again.  Remember, Mewn.  Keep your chin up, your head held high, and watch everyone be amazed!   =^_^=</font><font size="6">

Moonday, the Fourteenth day of Flocktime, 591cy</a>

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today was a fairly good day.  We were able to, pretty much, relax and enjoy our day.  I decided to try on my new studded leather armor to break it in.  Yeah, I wanted to see how it fit and looked on me, too.  Arrest me.  As soon as I come down the stairs, though, Quadro started whooping and hollering at me to �work it�. Whatever �it� was, I am sure from Quadro�s reaction, �it� was something that I was not prepared to find out about.  At first, I thought that I had put my armor on wrong.  After I got back up stairs, I saw that I had donned it correctly.  So, I put on my regular clothes.  I do have to say, they�re a lot more comfy than armor.<br>
 
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I make it back down stairs and sit at the table just in time to order lunch.  I ordered baked vegetables and a glass of Celarian Ruby wine.  A little expensive, but I was going to celebrate our achievements.  I, for one, am very proud of want we accomplished.  Then it happened.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Just before our food was brought to us, I heard everyone talking about going to Vurbobonc.  Yeah, I am sure, Mewn, that you remember what happened there to make you get here.  With me being not sure if what happened had blown over, I tried to talk everyone out of going there.  No such luck.  All I did was make everyone suspect me again.  Oh, I do NOT want to go to Vurbobonc.  I can only hope that no one recognizes me there.  This could get a little tricky.  At least I can go and see how Jelanah is doing.  I have not seen her in months.  I hope that she is still doing all right.  I feel bad that I missed her 96th birthday.   I am really starting to worry about her health. Humans do not live near as long as we elves do.<br>   

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Something has happened to Julin.  He is being nice to me.  He actually offered to let me use his disguise kit that he has.  He�s up to something.  The stuff in that kit will eat my face off or something like that.  Maybe he got enough sleep.  He sleeps a long time even for a human.  Well, like I said: Today was a day of relaxation and reflection.  We are going to Vurbobonc tomorrow.  I have a bad feeling about this trip.  No. No negative thoughts.  Nume wouldn�t stand for that.   So I will stop writing and get a good night�s trancing so that tomorrow I will be able to keep my chin up, hold my head high, and watch everyone be amazed.  (at how well I can hid stress).</font><font size="6">

Godsday, the Fifteenth Day of Flocktime, 591cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well I must say that today started out with an unexpected surprise.  After waking up this morning, I went down to groom my horse for the journey today.  After I was finished, I came back to the inn to get me some breakfast so that everyone would not be waiting on me to go.  As I was eating, I noticed this couple entering the inn.  The man was a severe looking man that so resembled Numenarh that it was quite unnerving.  The woman that walked a few feet behind him was a strikingly beautiful woman.  Both of them were elven.  I though about introducing myself to them, but the elven man sort of scared me.<br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>It was not long before Numenarh came down the stairs and stopped dead as the saw the elven couple.  This worried me for some reason that I cannot explain.  The man motioned to Nume for him to come over to his table.  Nume had this look on his face that was full of mixed emotions. Quadro came down almost right after Numenarh and evidently noticed the tension in the room right away.  He walked over to the table with Numenarh and the two people and started to talk with them.  The horror that waved over Numenarh�s face shocked me, so I came over to see what was going on.  That was how I found out the couple was Numenarh�s parents, Tenzanier and Maraniaol. They had come to collect him and take him home.<br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I could not believe that Numenarh was so meek while talking with his parents.  It was scary.  It was like they were telling him to jump and all he would say was how high.  I saw him act like this before only once, and that was when that wizard lady charmed him.  That concerned me greatly.  I didn�t see either of his parents gesturing to cast anything.  What am I saying?  Those were his parents.  They wouldn�t do something like that.<br> 

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As it turns out, Numenarh�s engaged to an elven girl named Menyoh.  A pretty name.  So why do I dislike her already?  Anyway, his parents came to collect him for her and get him to go to the magic school his father wanted him, too.  Although this Menyoh said that she would wait another ten years for Numenarh, his parents decided that it was time for him to return home.  Needless to say, this whole thing was starting to upset me.  Numenarh was not sticking up for himself at all.  What most bothered me, I think, was the fact that Numenarh actually looked like he was ashamed of us.<br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Finally after some convincing from the group and myself, Numenarh was able to convince his parents that he needed to come with us to Vurbobonc.  After which he would return home and wed Menyoh.  I don�t like that either.  At least it will give Nume time to think about a few things without his parents influencing his decisions.  After accepted what Numenarh had proposed, his parents left to return home.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Not much was said about the whole thing after they left.  Nor was anything said on the way to Vurbobonc.  Which brings me to tell about a very interesting � um� stranger.  We met the hooded guy while we were riding to Vurbobonc.  He was a tower of a person walking toward us.  When we had passed him I looked back at him and saw something that like to have startled the crud out of me.  He had a snout sort of like a hyena.  When we turned around to confront him, he drew a huge axe in defense.  We asked him to pull off his hood, and when he did, we were face to face with a gnoll by the name of Grawl.  He was raised by gnomes until they could not afford to feed him any longer.  For some reason he had not liked the company of his own kind.  Or rather they did not like him.  Even though he was rather vague in talking about himself, everyone but Numenarh and myself thought that he should join us to Vurbobonc.<br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Seeing Vurbobonc again after so long made me realize how much I missed it.  The closer we got to Vurbobonc the more I wanted to see my Jelanah.  Before we got too close, though, Julin allowed Grawl and myself to use his disguise kit so that we would not be recognized.  Grawl simply for the fact the he is a gnoll, and myself for the fact that I may still be wanted for that incident.<br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We entered the city, and its splendor was more than I remembered.  The hustle and bustle of the many people was like a warm blanket to me.  I told everyone in the group about a prominent tavern called the Silver Fish and that I would meet them there.  Quadro and Numenarh asked me where I was going, and I told them. To see the woman that raised me.  So after pointing them in the general direction to the Silver Fish, I left to go and see Jelanah.<br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Oh, I have missed this place.  Jelanah�s house had been a brothel since her mother�s husband died in some battle Jelanah referred to as the Short War.  In order to keep the families property from being taken away, Jelanah�s mother, Jeleket, started giving herself to certain city officials in order to gain their favor so that she could keep her family safe.  As much as Jeleket tried to keep her daughter from doing the same thing, Jelanah followed in her mother�s footsteps.  Inheriting her mother�s astuteness for business and taking over the business her mother had built upon her mother�s death.  Jeleket�s Roost flourished under Jelanah�s strict management.  Then she found me, a twenty-year-old elf girl who was all alone.  She took me in and raised as her own child.  She taught me almost everything I learned about living on my own.  She calls it the �Shadowy Arts�.  Spooky, huh?  Well, anyway, I learned a lot about stuff at Jeleket�s Roost.  I learned about all sorts of!
 things like how to: use a longsword and daggers (thanks Phalen!), liberate excess items from certain people that are carrying to much stuff (that Ratt-tu guy was good), and, to my dismay, the intricacies of how to have sex (from the women of the brothel). I asked for that last one and to this day I still can only think of one word of it whenever it comes up.  EWW!  I mean REALLY!  It sounds so messy.  I do not see how anyone could stand to do that!<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Anyway, enough of that before I make myself ill.  Like I said, I came to visit Jelanah to see how she was doing.  She is getting older.  I am afraid that she will not last much longer.  Even though her mind is still sharp, her body is unable to keep up.  I am glad that she has Zhanna and Ailyce to aid her.  The have treated Jelanah with as much love as any daughter would have.  Jelanah was blessed to have those two working for her, for Jelanah had never being able to have children of her own.  Hence, why she took me in as her own, I guess. Whenever I asked about why she could not have children, she would just smile a sad smile, cup my cheek in her hand, and tell me that she hoped that I would never understand why.  Anyway, Jelanah told me that when she dies she was going to leave the place in the care of Zhanna and Ailyce, and that they were to give me whatever I needed whenever I needed it.  I was glad to not inherit the place for I do not think that I have what it t!
akes to run a place like this.  Jelanah has always had that knack of knowing what was best for people and how to make them happy even before they knew what they needed or wanted.  She is an amazing woman.  She never had a negative thing to say about anyone, and always remained positive.  I can only hope that I could be half as amazing as she.<br>
   
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After leaving Jeleket�s Roost to meet up with the gang, I found they had let a druid named Tyro into the group.  A druid.  After the encounter we had with that one druid that almost killed us, they allowed one into the group.  Needless to say, I was quite apprehensive about the whole thing.  I mean, he had told everyone that he thought his mentor was up to something.  Like his mentor was trying to hide something.  Only when ask what sort of things, he could not give us a straight answer.  I guess they thought it was best so that they could find out what was going on between Tyro and his mentor, Jarroo, in the town called Hommlet.<br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Then I found out that Numenarh was not going to go with us, that he was going to go home tomorrow to get married to Menyoh.  We all to talk him into going to Hommlet with us at least to find out what was going on with Tyro and his mentor.  The compromise involved us going back with him to watch him get married.  That part I did not like.<br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I told everyone that I had a place that we all could stay at for free.  Upon reaching Jeleket�s Roost, I could tell by the shock on their faces that it was a brothel.  I think that they were all almost as nervous about them staying there as I was.  I frantically got everyone a room to sleep in, hating what I had to do in order to let them stay there.  Everyone said not to accompaniment from one of the women, all of them except Quadro.  Jenna was the only one that volunteered to be with him.  She said that she had never had a dwarf before.  EWW!<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well that is what happened today.  A strange day indeed.  Tomorrow, we head to Hommlet and see what we can see about Tyro�s mentor.  And as always, Mewn, remember what Jelanah has always told you.  �No matter what, Mewn, always keep your chin up, head held high, and everyone will be amazed.  For they will see that they can never take away your spirit or dignity.�</font><font size="6">

Waterday, the 16th day of Flocktime, 591cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today we left for Hommlet, and rode most of the day.  Nothing much happened today.  It will take about six days, including today, to reach Hommlet according to Tyro.  Everyone seems to be in thought; even Meepo is not talking much.  I think that is has to do with the thoughts of Numenarh possibly leaving us to go get married.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I see that Numenarh has started to show Quadro how to use the axe that Quadro bought.  I hope that Quadro doesn�t hurt himself, or Nume for that matter.  In return, Quadro has given, Numenarh his spell book to look at and practice with.  Oh, that could be a bad idea.  I remember what happened to Chanti when a guy tried to teach her magic.  She wasn�t right for a couple of days, and he wasn�t allowed back.  Jelanah made a new rule that no magic was to be used in the house.  Be careful
Nume.</font><font size="6">

<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Ran into some weather today, a lot of wind and dust being blown everywhere.  After making camp I went to the nearest river and took a bath.   Grawl seems to be pretty good at scaring up food for everyone.  Still cannot get more info out of Tyro, though.  That worries me.  I see that Numenarh has taken up writing in a journal, too.  I wonder how long he has been writing in it.  I wonder what he is writing.  No, Mewn, you would not like it if someone looked in your journal.  Still, though, I wonder.</font><font size="6">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>The stars are wonderful tonight.  The sky is so clear that you almost can feel yourself falling into those stars.  Boy, Nume is really going at it in that journal of his.
Seems like Quadro is getting the hang of swinging that axe around.  Nume is still trying to get the hang of magic.</font><font size="6">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, seeing as how boring THIS trip is going to be I think that I will take a small break in writing until we get to Hommlet.  Everyone is pretty much keeping to themselves all day.  All Quadro does is practice that darned axe and Nume keeps his head in that book.  All I can do to occupy my time is practice throwing my daggers into trees.  Oh well, I am sure that something interesting will happen soon.  Until we get to Hommlet, then.  Only two more days to go and we should be there.</font><font size="6">

Moonday, the twenty-first day of Flocktime, 591cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>My god, if I knew what was going to happened today I would have written in my journal yesterday.  Today was very hard for me to endure.  After reaching Hommlet we went straight to Tyro�s mentor�s house.  When we got there, though, Tyro�s mentor wasn�t there.  Julin asked me to pick the lock so that we could go in and search the place.  Against my better judgment, I did.  I guess that it made sense, though.  I mean, he could have been inside hurt or something.  Upon entering the house, we did not notice any signs of a struggle.  So here we go back to Hommlet to see if the druid had gone to town; to see if all we did was miss him.<br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I think that everyone could tell the Numenarh was getting anxious about keeping his word to his parents.  I could tell that he was thinking of going.  When confronted about it, he told us that he did indeed need to go.  This time I could tell that there was no talking him out of going.  All I could do really was watch him ride out of town.  I will miss you, Numenarh.  I hope that Menyoh will make you happy.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, it did not take long for Julin to assume command of the group in Numenarh�s absence.  As Julin was giving out tasks to everyone, Rask pulled me aside and handed me a ring.  This scared the crap out of me for, Jelanah had told me of the ritual that human�s do with rings.  Needless to say, I was relieved to find that he was not asking me to marry him.  He was giving the ring to me as a precaution; he would be able to cast a spell on it that would make it where I would get less hurt in battle.  I almost teared up.  No one had ever given me anything like this before.<br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After Julin was through giving out orders, we all set out to do our various chores.  Julin and I met a paladin.  At least we thought that he was a paladin, for he said that he had visions of fire and magic in this direction.  Then again he just could be loss in the head.  That was when I decided to go on my own to gather information.  So, I went to the potion shop where I met this little girl.  When I asked her if she were tending the store alone, she told me about her father named Spugingor going to a place called the Moat House.  He would go there looking for some sort of treasure that is supposedly lost there.  Only she was getting worried about him, for he was due a few days earlier.  She asked me if I and my group of friends could go and look for him.  I told her that I would ask them.  After buying a few potions, I went to the group with the information I received.  I found, upon reaching the rest of the group, that they had found out that the druid and possibly!
 a fighter friend of his had left for the Moat House, too.  I told them what I had found out and Rask requested then we go to the temple of St. Cuthbert before we leave town for the Moat House.  I don�t know what Rask had to talk to them about but he seemed emphatic about it.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>On the way out to the Moat House, we met up with a trapper who told us that he saw some activity at the Moat House � along with a blue dragon landing there.  Of course this does not deter Julin, I think I remember him saying something like, �No problem, we can have someone scout ahead.�  Even though I was not looking at the group at the time he said that, I could feel everyone looking at me.   Yeah, they made me the scout, of course.  It didn�t help matters that Rask tried to be funny with a jump joke.  I�m smack him later.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, we make it.  I notice that the drawbridge is new, and that worries me.  So I check it out very carefully for traps.  Then apparently just for the heck of it, Julin comes up and starts kicking rocks into the moat.  Possibly alerting everything and everyone in the Moat House of our presence.  I THOUGHT that the reason for someone to scout ahead was so that no one or nothing would be alerted.  Whatever.  Someone needs to knock some sense into that human.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Upon entering the Moat House, we discovered a huge bloodstain close to the middle of the place with a track of blood leading up some stairs and there was some kind of ceremonial blade in the middle of where the stain originated.  We found that there were two ways to go.  There was a tower with a huge hole in the side of it, and the stairs where the bloodstain led.   Quadro came with an idea of splitting up into two groups.  At first I thought he was joking around, but Julin liked the idea and proceeded in dividing up the group.  Quadro, Grawl and Rask in one group, and Julin, Meepo, Tyro, and myself in the other group.  Quadro�s group was to search the tower while the group I was with was to follow the bloodstain.  Just as Quadro�s group entered the tower, we had made it to the stairs.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Suddenly, we found ourselves almost knocked down by the blue dragon that the trapper had told us about.  This dragon was a lot bigger than that white one we found at the Sunless Citadel, and a lot older.  It immediately started to attack us by hovering a few feet above the ground.  At first I thought that this dragon was not to smart, for as big as it was it would take it some time to gain momentum from hovering to flight.  Then I realized what it was doing.  It was causing a huge dust cloud so that it would be harder for us to hit it.   While we were blinded, I heard Julin cry out in pain.  After a few moments to create a huge dust cloud, it then flew to a distance and started doing strafing runs on us.  Tyro and I ran for the walls for safety my thinking that we needed Nume right about now.  I think Grawl caught on to what we were doing for he took to the tower.  I tried to yell for everyone to make for the walls, but they were, I guess, to disoriented by the dragon!
�s attack.  Either that or freaking out.  Yeah, I was scared, too. But I would have time later to fall to pieces.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I saw Tyro heading for the stairs for safety along with his wolf, so I followed.  That was when I found something that would definitely help us.  I found a bow along with a little more than ten arrows.  A short bow, but hey it was a bow. When I came back out, I then saw something very scary.  I saw the dragon�s breath was as lightning as it fired upon the guys still in the center of the Moat House courtyard.  Just as I was getting ready to notch an arrow, I saw Numenarh firing at the dragon while still riding at full speed toward us.  He must have heard my thoughts somehow.  I started to find out this dragon�s tactics.  It was attacking who ever hurt it last, for it tried to kill Numenarh at the drawbridge.  Everyone started chasing the dragon once everyone noticed that Numenarh had returned.   Seeing that the dragon landing right near Numenarh, on the drawbridge, I had an idea.  I drank the potion that I bought from the little girl to make me be able to climb walls a!
nd started going along the top of the walls.  I was going to jump down onto its back and stab it as hard as I could, hopefully killing it.  I saw Grawl getting two great hits in on the creature, making it fly to a distance.  It told us that it was now time for us to die and it fired its lightning breath at Numenarh.  It glanced Nume hurting him a considerable amount.  Quadro, who was behind Numenarh, took the blast full in the chest, going straight through him and glancing Grawl.  Quadro fell to the ground lifeless.  This piece of dung of a dragon killed Quadro!  Fueled with grief, I fired a shot with the bow I had, only to miss.   I could only stand there and watch Numenarh run toward the dragon and certainly to his death.  Nume stood there in front of it defiantly and fired at it with his new bow, nailing it in the neck and killing it.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I was grief stricken.  Looking back, it was rather embarrassing.  I said earlier that I could fly apart later, well that was what I did and that was putting it lightly.  Numenarh shocked me back to one piece by yelling at me to get down to where they were.  We learned, from Rask, that Quadro could very well be brought back from the dead.  Numenarh immediately commanded Rask to take Quadro to the temple in Hommlet to do what ever it took to bring him back.  It was later that day when I was finally calm enough to start looking around the place for stuff to help us defend ourselves better in case something like this were to happen again.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I found some black studded leather armor that was every bit as well made as the one I was wearing. Thinking that I would be able to hide better in the dark in black armor, I tried it on.  It fit great.  Felt great, too.  I also found some other goodies on the two dead bodies. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you, in the room that I found the bow were two dead people.  The dead guy wore a weird lilac colored mask and had a large mace.  The shortbow, I guess, belonged to the dead woman.  They both wore a necklace that no one had seen before.  Meepo was able to see that the bow, mace and a scroll that I found on them were magical.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Later that evening Rask returned with Quadro alive and well, though Quadro seemed a little on the weaker side.  I was still so happy to see him alive that I lost myself in the moment and hugged Quadro tightly.  I think that I scared him when I told him that if he died on me again I would kill him.  I showed Quadro and Rask, the necklaces that the two dead people had worn.  Rask paled as he looked at them and told us that this necklaces belonged to followers of something call the Elder Elemental Eye.  Supposedly, this eye guy is a real bad something or other, totally evil.  Julin piped in and scolded us for not knowing who the Elder Eye guy was.  He started giving us a history lesson right there, telling us how he was beat back a long time ago.  Julin said that if they were building up another army, then this whole area if not all of Greyhawk was in peril.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>So we decided to go back to Hommlet and show what we found first thing in the morning.  So, yes. Today has been a severe emotional trek for me today.   But I think that Jelanah would be proud of the fact that I am still keeping my chin up, holding my head high, and watching everyone be amazed. (Including myself)</font><font size="6">

Godsday, the twenty-second day of Flocktime, 591cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As we all had decided last night, we went straight back to Hommlet.  Numenarh told Julin to gather all the things we to sell and buy, with those things, items that we would be needing when we returned to the Moat House.  That was when I realized that Nume was going to stay. While Julin was doing what Numenarh told him to do, the rest of us went to the temple of St. Cuthbert and to the captain of the guard to show them the necklaces that we found and what it might mean.  Both seemed distressed although they tried to down play it.  They thanked us and said that they would definitely look into it.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After we all regrouped and distributed the things bought, we went back to the Moat House.  Again I was nominated to be scout.  I didn�t mind though.  We made our way through some walkways and into a room with a wall that had collapsed.  I went over to the ruble to look through it and this icky thing tried to take a swipe at me.  When I yelled out in surprise, the guys rushed in and killed it.  It was rather comical, looking back on it, and sweet.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, we made our way through more walkways, until I found a secret door leading down some stairs.  We decided to come back later to see what was down there.  We found some more stairs later that also led down.  We followed those down until there was no light at all, so I pulled out my little everburning torch to light our way.  That was when I heard some noises further down the stairs.  I made my way back to the guys and told them what I heard.  I handed Numenarh my torch so that what ever was down there would think that I was further back than I was.  Everyone came down the stairs with me, Grawl right behind me.  He still gives me the creeps.  Upon almost reaching the bottom, Grawl calls out to warn me as he strikes down something to my right. I quickly tumble to the far end of the room to see that the room was occupied by two gnolls and a cleric with the same necklace of the Eye guy.  I also see that Grawl had killed the gnoll that he hit in one blow, adding to his!
 creepiness.  Just then, the cleric lady held out her necklace and said something that made the skeletons in the room come to life. They totaled around eight, including one huge one that looked like it was even more ugly when it was alive.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I knew just how to handle skeletons. Just as I started to sheath my sword when all of the skeletons, save the largest one, exploded into dust.  Scared to death, I looked around to see a grinning Rask who looked at me and said, �See? I told you I could do that.�  The largest Skeleton must have gotten scared, too, for it was trying to get away as fast as it could.  The cleric lady didn�t seem to like that to well for she shot some sort of black energy into the large skeleton and it wasn�t scared anymore.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Seeing that everyone had the large skeleton and the other gnoll taken care of, Rask went after the cleric lady. So did Numenarh.  Just as Rask closed in on her, she slapped him really hard.  I knew she had to have magically enhanced her hand for I saw black energy flash from her hand as she slapped him.  Rask flew mad and slapped her back with the same thing, only his hand flashed purple.  Numenarh then told her several times to surrender or die.  She chose death each time.  Crazy woman.   Well, finally we were able to subdue her and tie her up.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After the fight, we started to search some of the rooms. I went into a room that had a lantern in the center lighting it.  I found along with the lantern, four items that were ominously laying next to the lantern: a scepter, an iron torch with three cones, a small black sphere, and a black metal tube. I decided to leave them where they were, for there was assuredly a magical trap on them that would do worse things to me than kill me.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Grawl and Quadro entered a room to see what was in there.  I heard a crash, someone yell out in pain, and then yelling, �Stay back�.   I ran in there thinking that Grawl had attacked Quadro but found that Quadro and Grawl were fighting a man hiding behind a rack of weapons.  Sensing that something was not right. I tried to calm the guy down, and then I recognized him from the description from the little girl.  It was Spuginor.  After we convinced him that Grawl was a good Gnoll and Meepo was a good kobold, we fed him.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I showed him the items that we found and he told me that every one of those items were magical.  He picked up the metal tube and opened it, pulling out a scroll that showed how do some evil ritual.  I would rather not go into what it said to do.  It was rather gross.  So we packed all of it up, sent Spuginor home to his little girl, and went on with what we came here to do.<br>
 
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>It was not long before we ran into some more undead.   Three ghouls and something called a ghast.  The ghast was rather nasty smelling.  Julin lost his lunch several times fighting along side Grawl.  We on the other hand made short work of the ghouls.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I think that I am getting the hang of finding secret doors.  This place is riddled with them.  We found our way to a dug out cavern that led to a place that you could feel the evil.  There was an alter the closer you got to it, the more it turned to a translucent amethyst color with a black center.  Julin touched it and screamed as he fell paralyzed.  Eerie.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I started frantically looking around.  Well, I DON�T like him, but he did help me out when I needed it.  Debts must always be paid in full. That is what Jelanah always said.  One of the pillars had several compartments, each holding an item. After getting them all and laying them out, we saw that there was four items: a small bead, a skin covered drum, some silver chimes, and a bronze brazier with four chunks of incense.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I took the drum and held it really close to his ear and then tapped the drum very lightly.  As soon as I did that, the alter turned translucent again and the black center turned out to be an eye.  The eye turned and looked at us.  Suddenly, I felt extremely week, as did most everyone else.  All except Rask and I think Quadro.  Needless to say everyone was a little upset at me.  Cannot say that I blame them, though.  I could have just killed everyone.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After a while Julin was back to normal, although we weren�t.   After some deliberating, we decided to stay there and rest.  So, that is where we are now; in a cavern, weak from my stupidity, and hoping to be able to survive tomorrow.  I am still trying, Jelanah, but it is hard to keep my chin up, to hold my head high, and see everyone be amazed. (in a good way)     -_-</font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I think that it is time for me to reevaluate my life.  Either I am not as good as I thought I was or I am way over my head in trouble.  Everyone seems to be taking all that has and is happening to us in stride!  How can everyone be so laidback but all that has happened?  Quadro, even after dying, doesn�t seem phased by all of this.  Numenarh, with his stone faced expressions; I think that only a rock would know what he thinks.  Rask, all he does is get mad and then he is fine.  I think Rask has something wrong with him.  Julin just looks forward to the next big bad we come up against with wide-eyed vigor while telling me to look at it first.  Tyro, who KNOWS what HE is thinking; his silence is really unnerving.  Poor Meepo doesn�t really know what to be scared of unless someone tells him he should be.  Who knows where Grawl went!  And here I am barely able to keep myself from bawling my eyes out, wishing nothing more than to just to be able to stay alive but having to!
 seem as strong as everyone else.  If I don�t, I could get someone or everyone else killed.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I know.  It seems like I am on a tirade.  Well when I get through reminding you of what happened to you, you will get the picture.  Not that you will ever forget today.</font><p align="left"><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today started out not so good and only got worse through the day.  Rask used his magic to help Numenarh and Quadro feel better.  I guess I was left out as punishment for what I stupidly did the day before; tapping that darned drum.   In order to hide the hurt on my face I started to scout ahead so that I could get my mind on the task at hand; surviving.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After a bit, I came to a door that was trapped and locked.  Only I found out that it was trapped after I found that it was locked.  When I tried the handle, some sort of acid spewed out.  Luckily, I saw it in time and was able to dodge the spray.  Nasty stuff, that.  Ate through about an inch of stone.  Well, knowing that now it was safe since I trip the trap, I proceeded to unlock the door.  I looked to see what was in there and reported back to the rest about the room.  It was pretty much empty for the most part.  It had a box that was lying on a bed.  Of course it was locked, too.  And looking at it closely I could tell it was trapped.  The thing was that I could not see how in the world the mechanisms worked.  I concluded that it was a magical trap.  Julin again with his willingness for others to get hurt suggested that I try and disarm it.  After some discussion and Tyro proving me right about the trap, Rask came over to me and took me hand.  Again scaring the cr!
ud out of me by covering the ring he gave me and chanting a spell over it.  I don�t think that he has a thing for me, for I remember how all the men at Jeleket�s roost acted toward me when they liked me.  He doesn�t act like that.  It was kind of refreshing.  He then told me that I would be all right if something bad happened.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, as it turned out, I needed it.  The trap strung and smacked me in the eye.  Figuratively, of course.  That spell made it where I did not get hurt nearly as bad as I would have.  Imagine feeling pain course through your body only you know that it should hurt more than it is because you can also feel it leaving your body.  A strange feeling, to say the least.  Anyway, we found some pretty unusual things inside that box.  The most unusual was this paper that Julin read to us.  It was a page from a journal of guy named Geynor.  He evidently worshiped that Eye Guy.  Oh, and he was crazy.  But he did write down about some big ole obelisk thingy.  Pretty strange stuff.  At least that blue dragon killed their leader before we got here.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After studying what we had found in the box, we decided to head on.  I opened one of the doors out of the room that turned out to be a trick door and, yes, it tripped a switch that cause a large sound down the hallway.  Of course we go and investigate the sound that turned out to be a gate that had come down.  Julin called it a portcullis.  Instead of trying to get through the gate yet, we decided that it would be best for me to go further down the hallway to see if there was anything there.  I found nothing so I headed back toward the guys only I notice something strange about a wall and check it out. Yep, a secret door.  I marked it with my chalk so it would be easy to find later and went on back to the group.  Just as I got to them Quadro was handing Numenarh his axe so that Nume could hack at the gate.  Well, I didn�t want to wait around watching someone beat up a door, so I went to see what was behind the secret door.  I was surprised to see a wench there.  Of co!
urse, I had to see what it did.  Just as I started turning it, Nume stopped chopping.  After I was done, I came over and found out that the wench went to the gate that Nume had already chopped through.  It was sort of funny.  I thought that I almost saw exasperation show on Nume�s face.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Come to find out, the way that the gate was to protect came out to that one secret door we never went down. We effectively had gone in a circle.  Yeah, we went back to go another way.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After a while, we came up to a room (with me as scout of course) that turned out to contain a good many gnolls.  They were good at hiding and remaining quiet, for I was totally surprised by them.  Luckily, they missed me and I was able to move back.  Just then, I felt a hot pain pierce the back of my shoulder from one of Nume�s arrows.  I know he felt bad about it for I honestly saw concern on his face for me after the battle.  Seeing that I was just in the way I retreated to the back so the Numenarh could get off his shots.  When I got the rear, I found Rask and requested that he get the arrow out of my back.  Again he did his healy thing on me and again I felt better.  Seems like I am always in need of his healing.<br>
   
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Rask must be getting tired of having to heal everyone, for after healing me he ran straight into the thick of things just bashing away.  I don�t know why I suddenly got scared that he might die.  I just felt that he would not be able to heal himself in time when he needed to and he would die.  I rushed in and tumbled to the other side of the two remaining gnolls, getting struck as I tumbled by them.  I saw the one closest to Rask fall to the ground, making the last one retreat back against the wall.  That was when I made my move and stabbed it right in where I thought that heart would be.  Turns out that I might have been right, for it dropped like a stone.  Right then I started thinking that things were looking up and that we just might make it.  Especially since Numenarh told everyone that we all needed to talk about some things.  Among of which were, I think, what we needed to do to be able to better help one another.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I think that Numenarh could have gone about it a different way, though what way I cannot think of how even now as I write this.  He started out by talking to Rask about how best the group would benefit from him, like his healing and if he were dead that would not be able to do that.  I was not able to tell what exactly what was being said for I was searching the dead gnoll bodies for anything that would be useful.  I then heard Rask get really upset, threw the ring he wore that he said would help me from being hurt to the ground, and stormed off saying that if the group didn�t want him around then he would just leave.  I still do not understand why Rask would throw the friendship he and I have because of whatever someone else said.  I do not think that I would ever do that.  I mean these guys are my family now.  Yeah, even Julin.  He�s the younger brother that always tries to make you mad.  I don�t think of Tyro or Grawl as family.  Not yet.  Anyway, I called out to R!
ask asking him why he was leaving me like that.  He said that no one needs him here.  How wrong he is I think he will never understand.  I then made a comment about him being less thick-skinned than a girl like me.  Well it worked.  What I said evidently cooled his temper and he came back.  When it was seen the Rask was going to return, I noticed a smile on Julin that I had never seen before.  I think that it was a smile of approval.  Nah.  Couldn�t have been.  Not from him.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After some debate, we decided on a voting system that would have driven a crazy man sane.  I still have yet to understand how Quadro come to be leader of the group instead of Numenarh.  Well, we�ll see.  Quadro might do all right.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Later, as I was scouting ahead, I heard two voices talking to each other.  Well not the voices but what the voices belonged to were talking to each other.  When I inspected closer, I found that there was a human and some sort of lizardman.  Judging from the stench from it, I was able to discern that it was a creature known as a troglodyte. Nasty buggers.  I made it back to the group to tell them about what I found and we decided on what our best options were in attacking them.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Except for the fact that the human was a powerful cleric and he cast something that made a mist so thick that no one could use any sort of bow at attack with.  Luckily I had been able to jump onto a small pedestal to have a good advantage point.  After killing the major threat, the cleric, we handled the troglodyte without much trouble.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Oh, I forgot about the platform that those two were evidently guarding. It had a rope that was attached to it so that it could be lowered.   Instead of going down right then, though, we decided to rest for the night.  Me here and the rest back where the gnolls were.  So that is where I am now; watching over this big slab and being able to write in my journal without the chance of anyone looking over my shoulder.</font><p align="left"><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Good luck to you, Numenarh: Bowmen Extraordinaire.  I only hope that you will find the happiness to break that stony face of yours.  And I hope that you are correct in that woman being Menyoh.  May she treat you well.<br>
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Good luck to you, Quadro: Dwarven Wizard.  I hope that you realize just how unique you are in this world.  My mother, Jelanah, would love to meet you.  May everyone�s faith in you be exceeded only by your ability to lead.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Good luck to you, Rask: the Destroyer of Evil, your faith is your strength.  Let it not falter, for if you nurture it, it will nurture you.  You are a rare gift to this world, Rask.  May you find a way to use your temper to fuel your faith.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Good luck to you, Meepo: Goblin Slayer.  You are unique even unto the kobolds you grew up with.  We are the lucky ones to have known you, Meepo.  May everyone that you meet in your life know you as we have come to know you.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>And you, too, Julin of the Golden Voice.  Even though I have found you strange and off-putting at times, I do have a certain amount of respect for you as I hope that you do for me.  May you never receive a permanent case of laryngitis.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Tyro and Grawl, though I do not know either of you, I hope that life does treat you well.  Grawl, you scare me.  Tyro, You need to open up and talk more about yourself.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>May we all have luck to spare in the forthcoming days.  I know that we will need them. And to every one of us, remember to keep your chin up, be proud, and watch everyone be amazed!</font><font size="6">

Freeday, the twenty-fourth day of Flocktime, 591cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I will never end an entry like that again.  I hate that place.  I hope to never go to another place like that again, though I know we will at some point.  I know one thing, though.  I will forever be more watchful of my surroundings, and expect the unexpected always.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>This morning Rask restored, by magic, some of the weakness that was caused by the drum two days ago.  We were now ready to go down to where ever the slab lowered.  It was decided that Quadro, Tyro, Meepo and I were to be the ones to go down first.  As we were lowered, I saw Numenarh manning the rope that lowered us.  I still get amazed at how strong he is; he lowered us down all by himself.  We were lowered past an underground waterfall.  When we reached about thirty feet, the shaft that we were in became a huge cavern of blackness that even my everburning torch could not reach all of.  The lower we got the colder it became.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Finally, we reached the bottom that turned out to be a large circular platform.  The water that fell from the waterfall we saw above splashed unto the smooth black stone surface of the platform that the slab came to rest on; only to run of the edge into a chasm to deep that the splash we heard was only a distant echo.  Upon closer inspection we noticed that there were small tendrils of green webbing going through the surface of the platform as well.   Quadro saw that there was another slab behind us and proceeded to walk to it.  About four steps out from the slab we were on, those tendrils began to come alive and wrap themselves around his feet.  I saw a paleness flow over his face and then was gone, that was went he ran back for the safety of the slab.  Knowing that we had to get off of the slab in order to allow Nume, Rask, and Julin to come down after us.  We decided that the best thing for us to do was to get to the other slab as quickly as we could.  Quadro went !
first, then Tyro, Meepo, and last was me.  We all made it to the slab just as the one we left started to raise.  I decided to pull out my sword in case those tendrils got tired of waiting for us to move from the slab we were on.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Suddenly, out of the darkness came something that only the fevered nightmares of an insane person could dream up.  It looked like a giant brain with a parrot�s beak and tentacles dangling from underneath it.  I had time to slash at it only once before it was on me.  The thing was as big as I was.  It struck me with one of its tentacles and I felt all of the muscles in my body seize up.  I was paralyzed!  It wrapped another tentacle around me and started to lift me up and away.  I knew I was going to die.  This thing was going to eat me alive!  I was actually going to have to watch this thing eat me and not be able to scream or fight back!<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Just then, Meepo, brave little stupid Meepo, jumped unto the thing to try and keep it from taking me off.  Bless him.  Of course the creature got a hold of Meepo as well and he was paralyzed.  I could tell what Tyro did for I could not see him from where I was.  What I did see was Quadro doing to same thing that Meepo did.  I expected better from him than that.  Like maybe trying to grab Meepo and me instead.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Just as sudden as it all began, though, it was over.  We were now falling with the creature; only we were falling rather slowly.  About half way down the side of the platform I felt the paralyses wear off and I started screaming.  I was able to see that this creature had a hold of Quadro, Meepo and myself.  I hoped that tyro was all right; him and his pet wolf.  After reaching the bottom, I hastily got myself free of the vile thing.  As did Quadro and Meepo after their paralyses wore too.   It was not long before we were all together again, thank the gods.  I think that I was able to hide the amount I was shaken by the whole ordeal; either that, or they didn�t care or they just assumed I was all right.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We could all feel the cold seeping into our bones.  I was surprised to not see ice forming in places.  We found three things of interest there.  Tyro, I hope, accidentally stepped onto one of them, a black sun sigil, which got him hurt somehow.  I hope that Tyro will be all right.  He hasn�t said that he was hurt badly so I guess he�s fine. Julin found an archway and decided that it was a good idea for someone to stick their hand through it.  I knew that he was thinking of me at the time but before he could voice it I picked up a rock and tossed it into the archway to see what would happen.  Of course, nothing happened. I just looked at Julin just daring him to tell me to put my hand through, what I knew was, the death trap.   I voiced my concern that it was a bad idea to even mess with it, but Julin paid me no heed and waked right up to it and stuck his hand into the archway.  Yeah, it activated and something grabbed him. I saw him stiffen and I knew what had happene!
d to him.  He was paralyzed.  I knew it.  I tried to tell him.  He was almost pulled in before we caught him.  I rushed in, along with everyone else, to grab Julin and keep him from being pulled through.  Just then a tentacle lashed out and grabbed a hold of my arm and I felt the all too familiar muscle seizing effect, only from another one of those brain creatures.  It started pulling itself out from whatever hell it came from and into where we were.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I then heard everyone yelling about someone flying above us.  I knew that Julin and I couldn�t do anything to help anyone, and I could not hear Rask, so I had to assume that the people left to fight was Quadro, Meepo, Nume, and Tyro.  Finally, Julin and my paralyses wore off in tine for us to lend a hand to the battle.  After quickly looking around to see where we would be the most helpful Julin and I went for the already hurt cleric guy that had been flying about.   While Julin was attacking him, I tumbled in behind him and was able to deal the killing blow to the cleric.  At pretty much the same time, Rask felled the brain creature with a spell.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As we again checked over our wounds and counted our blessings, we decided that it was a good idea to leave the portal archway alone.  We also had a pretty good discovery on the body of the flying rabbi.  We found a pearl that Rask can use, and another piece of paper that told us more about these evil eye worshipers.  It even had �the evil one�s� name of it.  Even now I�m a little superstitious about mentioning that name.  The reason being is in what happened next.  Julin went of to the other sigil and said the name on the paper and he fell down dying!  Even Rask�s healing magic had no effect.  Julin was going to die!  Numenarh eventually was able to stabilize him in time to keep him from dying, thank the gods.  When Julin came to, he exclaimed, �That was cool!� I slapped him.  Hard.  Dumb human.  I�ll not forgive him for scaring me like that, especially considering what happened to Quadro just three days ago.  Has it been THAT long ago?  It feels a lot longer than tha!
t.  Anyway, when Julin came through, there was also a black dagger with Julin�s name on it.  Not a good sign.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After all of that, we were starting to feel the cold numbing our bodies and making it hard to move around.  Luckily, we found a tunnel leading away from the cavern we were in, only it came to a dead in which made no sense to me.  I searched for a secret door, finding none.  That was when Quadro noticed something strange about the wall.  He said that it was not a natural wall, that it was magically created.  I then suggested the scroll that we found that shapes stone.  Everyone agreed and Rask used it to make a hole for everyone to climb through.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I could tell that everyone was getting anxious to get out from this miserable place.  I know that I was.  Following along the tunnel we found some offshoots and decided to check them out on the way out.  We came across these two weird looking lizard chickens with glowing red eyes.  I think that we all thought that they were there to guard something for we attacked them and found out that if these things bite you, they can turn you to stone.  Luckily, that didn�t happen, although it almost happened to Julin and Quadro.   After killing them, we found about twelve gems worth, I guessed, about a hundred gold pieces each.  Oh and we captured one of the lizard chickens to see if it would be worth selling in town.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We decided then that it was a good idea to find the horses and go back to Hommlet and made it out through the tunnel that we were in.  The tunnel came out not to far down river from where we left the horses.  When we returned to Hommlet we sold most of what we found at the Moat House.  When we entered the scroll shop, the shopkeeper about freaked out that we had what he called a cockatrice and that they were illegal to own. So Numenarh killed it to accommodate the owner.  After describing that brain creature to the fellow at the scroll shop, he told us that it was called a grell.  We later found out that we needed to back to Vurbobonc in order to sell some of the things if we wanted to get optimal money for them.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>This was when I learned about the letter that Numenarh had me send to Menyoh was in actuality a summons for her.  He asked her to meet him here at Hommlet. Yea, I get to meet her.  I can only hope that Numenarh couldn�t see the amount of disappointment on my face.  Why am I even upset about it?  Numenarh should be happy.  So, I will be glad to meet her and I hope that she and I will be good friends.  Before we know it she will be on her way back home.  No harm done.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Julin found out from the innkeeper, that the guys from the Moat house stayed at the inn.  Julin got the impression that she was working with them and that is was a good idea that we kept our collective head low and not talk about anything we know about the Moat House.  Okay.  That worried me.  Just what exactly did we get mixed up in.  All we can now do, I guess, is wait.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>So, right now I am in my room; writing, trying to stay as calm as I can, and, of course, keeping my chin up, holding my head high, and watching everyone be amazed. (that we are still alive!)=^_^=</font><font size="6">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>All things considered, I think that today was fairly productive.  Today started with some interrogations of the prisoners we brought back from the Moat House.  Well all of that seemed pretty boring to me, so I decided to go and have a look-see around the town.  I can only guess that Numenarh felt the same way for he went with me to the potion shop to see how Spuginor was doing.  After all, he might have some potions ready for us.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>When Nume and I got to Spuginor�s shop, we found Grawl there.  Needless to say I was a little surprised to see him there after he had vanished like he did.  That was when he reminded me about him escorting Spuginor back to town. Yeah that was pretty embarrassing.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After leaving Spuginor�s potion shop, Nume said that he thought it was a good idea to check with the others for they might be done with the interrogations.  So, we went.  But when we got there, we found that everyone had left fairly quickly to Jaroo�s house.  Fearing that something was amiss, we decided to try and catch up to them, and it didn�t take very long.  We found them all, along with the city guard named Elmo, standing outside of Jaroo�s house talking.  Julin saw us walking up and hurriedly told us that Jaroos was dead and there was something called a doppelganger replacing him.  That was when we decided to try and find him.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I think that since Tyro lived in this area, it was thought that he would be best to track down Jaroo.  Well Tyro did a good job following him.  We followed Jaroo�s tracks through town and to the flourmill.  Just as I was going to go and see if the door was locked or even trapped, Grawl busted in the door.  Sometimes I think that Grawl is a little too enthusiastic about getting into fights.  Almost to the point that he could get us all killed if he is not careful.  Anyway, we rush into the flourmill ready to fight.  Only nothing was in there but flour bags and loose flour on the floor.  Well as there turned out there was a trap door in the floor where Jaroo�s tracks led too.  Grawl was getting ready to bust that door too, when Julin started to get excited about Rask putting a small bag of flour into his backpack.  I was astounded by the amount of noise a bag of flour could cause.  Not only were Rask and Julin arguing about it, but Grawl and Quadro got into it the argum!
ent as well.  The only reason Rask was getting the bag of flour in the first place was that it might have proven useful in some way.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After the argument was dropped about the flour, I tried to see if I could unlock the trap door. Seeing that it was barred from the inside, it came to Grawl to bust in this door, too.  Julin rushed in upon five people waiting down there.  And this was how we were committed to fighting these guys.  After all we had to save Julin, now.  After Nume, Rask, Grawl and myself rushed in after Julin, I saw a Lightning bolt shoot out the door.  The first thing I thought was that there was a blue dragon in here with us, and then I realized that a wizardess had cast it.  I saw Tyro fall, then Quadro and I heard someone call out for Meepo.  Because I was distracted, I was hit by a woman who touched me causing pain to course through my body. Then a half-orc slashed me with a bastard sword.   I was able to get a slash into both of them before I fell unconscious.  I remember knowing, before I lost total consciousness, that I was going to be all right thought, for I knew that Rask was !
going to heal me.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I woke up, yet again, to Rask giving me a quick smile and looking around for more wounded, for the fight was still going on.  As I got up though, the last enemy surrendered.  We tied him up along with the rest that had not died yet.  Rask healed them enough to make sure that they were not going to bleed to death.  Elmo told us that he was going to go and get some of the other guards to have the bad guys arrested.  I think that Elmo is a pretty nice guy, for he told us that the prisoners were not going to need most of their equipment where they were going to be going and if some of it were to not be here when he came back, he would not remember what all they had.  After Elmo left, I found a chest that was magically trapped.  Another long drawn out heated discussion ensued to figure out that we could do what we did last time with a magical trap.  So Rask activated the ring he gave me to make it where I take a less amount of damage whenever I get hurt and I proceeded to !
try and disable the trap.  Well, as you might have guessed, I messed up but was able to move out of the way of a stream of acid.  Makes me shiver to think what that stuff would do to a person.  It dissolves stone.  Nasty Stuff.<br>
   
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Anyway, inside that chest was a decent amount of gold pieces, a disguise kit, and a note that mentioned more info about the goings on of the followers of the Eye Guy.  We decided to go and interrogate the guy that was awake after getting some items that Quadro saw a magical aura around and some really well made armor and weapons.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>So we went to the constable to see the prisoners and question them.  After asking a few though Julin asks everyone if we could ask them more questions tomorrow.  We all agree and leave.  That was when I took the opportunity to have the magical items identified.  Knowing that Julin had better people skills than I did, I asked him to see if he could haggle the price a bit.  He did and it will be a few day them to all be identified. So I left here with the scroll shop�s owner to have him identify the items.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>And now here I am in another room in the inn, smoothing aches and pains, taking a long hot bath and writing in my journal.  I think that I am starting to understand why everyone seems to not be fazed by all that is happening to us.  It is easier to not think on everything, for that is when everything starts to seem overwhelming.  Well, all I got to say is that I will continue to hold my chin up high, stay proud, and watch everyone be amazed.</font><font size="6">

Sunday, the Twenty-sixth day of Flocktime, 591 cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today was a wild day!   I saw something that I have never seen before.  One of the women turned out to be something called a tiefling.  I could still tell the she was a female, but she had cloven hooves for feet and she had horns on the head.  She was just laying there in the cell, breathing and unconscious.  Julin told me that one of her parents was human and the other was a batzu or something like that.  He said it was either a devil or demon.  Wow.  I wonder if she took up with the now-prisoners out of fear of what everyone else would think of her.  I bet if we were to give her a chance she would turn over a new leaf.  I will have to see if I can talk to the group about this.  See if they will agree.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>While I was marveling at the tiefling female, Julin found out a great deal of info from the other prisoners that were awake.  He found out that there were three options we could follow (four if you include not continuing on with pursuing the Eye Guy followers) .  They included going to Rastor where a small cell of followers are supposedly holding up, the main temple proper where the majority of the followers are, or a place regarded as �the place of all consumption� that is a big crater.  We decided to go to Vurbobonc for better supplies.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>At the inn, where we decided to meet before the trip to Vurbobonc, I saw Meepo walking up with a mangy little rat that Meepo named Calcryx Two.  I already dislike this rat.  Turns out that it is his familiar.  Icky, nasty little thing.  It just had better not climb on me.  Before we all left, I went to the scroll shop to collect the item not yet identified and thank him for the ones he did get to.  After that, we left for Vurbobonc, my home.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We rode for a good bit before stopping for the night to rest.  So here I am, at the campfire looking at everyone sleep and writing in my journal.  Though not much happened today, I think that today was pretty eventful.  I will write more if something interesting happens on the way to Vurbobonc and, as always, I will keep my chin up, head held high, and watch people be amazed.  (and that tiefling was pretty amazing)</font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">Waterday, the first day of Wealson, 591cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I think that today may be the most pivotal day in my life.  I found out some important information about who I really am.  Only, now that I have, it scares me to death.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Upon reaching Vurbobonc, I went straight to Jeleket�s Roost in order to check on Jelanah.  Before I went to talk to Jelanah, though, I warned her about Quadro, who was hot on my heels to see her.  I asked Jenna that if she was not interested in Quadro at all to please let him down easily.  The last few men that became interested in her in a more permanent manner, she started yelling at them, asking them if they were stupid or something.  It is not a pleasant event to behold.  I told her that I considered it a personal favor. She agreed to handle him with as much care as possible.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I, then, went to see Jelanah.  She was lying in bed and not looking all to well.  She looked genuinely glad to see me.  She told me that she had something that she needed to give me.  I thought it strange that she produced a letter.  The first thing I thought was that it was from her in case she had died before I was able to get back to her the next time.  It wasn�t.  It was a letter from my father.  My REAL father.  I will write it here just in case I were to ever lose that letter.  Not that I will, of course.</font><p align="left">


<font face="Monotype Corsiva">


Mewn,<br>
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I hope that you never have to read this letter, for if you do then something has gone terribly wrong or worst; I may be dead.  I cannot explain what has or will happen, because I don�t know myself.  Something has happened to her, but what I do not know.  I do know that you may be in danger - from your own mother, Tilan, in fact.  For this reason, your birth name has been hidden from you. It is Stacia Nailo, though you should keep that hidden.  For this reason, I have left you with Jeleket, for her establishment is not a place your mother would think to look, should she attempt to find you.</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

With all my love, <br>
Mandrick Nailo<br></font><p align="left">


<font face="Monotype Corsiva">


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>In human, my name means Star Nightbreeze.  My father�s human name is Clearwater and my mother is named Nest.  From questions that I asked Jelanah, found out that Tilan is a cleric of Aerdrie Faenya and Mandrick is a wizard.  Though she did not know what my parents looked like, Jelanah had heard Jeleket say that I looked a lot like my mother and that I had my father�s nose.  I was told of how Jeleket met my parents.  I now know where Jelanah got her gifts for the �shadowy arts�.  My father had brought me to Jeleket and asked her to take care of me.  Owing my father, she took me in and raised me.  My parents were from a place called Enstad, somewhere in the elven nation of Celene.  Some day, I will find my way there and find my relatives.  From Jelanah told me, Jeleket thought of my parents as really good people.  I have to find them.  Needless to say, all of this had left me stunned to say the least.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As I walked up to the group later, I saw that they were arguing about something.  When I got closer, though, I found out that it was about money.  Rask was angry about having to pay for something when he was not compensated for paying to have Quadro raised from the dead.  I was startled to find that this was the first time Rask had brought it up, at least in front of me.  After listening to the same round and round argument I became angry myself and yelled for everyone to just shut up and gave Rask the 500 gold he was griping about.  I started to walk away so that no one would see me cry.  That was when Julin told me that I owed him 142 gold, so I tossed that to the ground and continued to walk off.  Numenarh asked me what was wrong, and all I told him was that I needed to be alone.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I found a place called The Blue Sky, went in, and ordered some wine to drink.  Close to when Nume and I first met, he asked me what my adult name was, for elves had two names in their life. A birth name and a name that they chose upon becoming an adult.  I told him that I didn�t know, that I guessed it was Mewn.  Now I know it is.  I started to read the letter again when Numenarh walked up to the table and asked me if he could sit down.  I put the letter, I think, too quickly, for Nume asked me what it was.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I told Nume about what was in the letter and what my real name was and about my parents.  He then talked me into going to the scroll shop to have the owner try to scry on my father.  Only He could not find him due to him either being dead or being protected from scrying.  I prefer to believe the latter.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As Nume and I walked back to The Silverfish, I told him everything I learned about my parent in between sobs.  It was rather embarrassing.  Numenarh agreed to not tell anyone of the letter or about my parents.  Thank you, Numenarh; I know that I can trust you.  And though you may not know it yet, you can trust me.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>When we reached The Silverfish, we noticed that everyone was not really talking to each other.  I wonder what happened in our absence.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, that is what happened today.  Now it is time for my bath and a nice rest.  Remember, Stacia or Mewn or whom ever you are, to keep your chin up, your head held high, and watch everyone be amazed. =^_^=</font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">



<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today has proven to me that no matter how well things start to seem, something bad will inevitably take a turn for the worse.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After trancing, I decided to have a talk with Julin and entered his room to talk to him.  I was a little annoyed that he was still asleep until I remembered that he was human.  They need a lot of sleep.  I decided to wait for him to wake up and talk to him then by pulling up a chair and waiting.  I watched him sleep for a good while.  The sun had risen for to the point that the roosters weren�t even calling their wake-up songs.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Finally he woke up and saw me sitting there and asked me what I was doing in his room.  I told him and asked him if he was trying to kill us all.  He said no and we discussed how non-tactical arguments were.  After a few moments of slightly tense discussion, we agreed that if he didn�t argue in times of possible combat, I would not break into his room anymore.  Though he did threaten to tell the Watch that I was in town, I thought that the threat was an empty one.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We left his room and went down stairs to breakfast.  I ordered some eggs and spiced potatoes with water.  We all started discussing whether to go straight to the temple proper or not.  I brought up the fact that Nume needed to go back to Hommlet to see if Menyoh was there.  After all, we needed to go there anyway to get the potions that Spuginor owed us.  It was then decided that we would go through Hommlet to get to the temple proper.  Just as my breakfast arrived, Sandy came to me with a worried look on her face.  She came into the Silver Fish from Jeleket�s Roost to tell me that the Watch had heard that I was in town and were heading to the Silver Fish to arrest me.  Yeah, I got real nervous real quick.  Maybe Julin�s threat wasn�t an empty one after all.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I started urging that we leave immediately.  When everyone just looked at me as if I had lost my mind, I started becoming even more emphatic.  I could feel beads of sweat forming on my forehead and the back of my neck.  When Quadro asked me what was up, I told him that I would explain later when we got out of Vurbobonc.  Well, we made out of town, albeit barely.  I could tell that I was almost spotted by the Watch.  It was almost felt like that everyone recognized me and was walking me with continued interest.  After we made it out of Vurbobonc, Quadro confronted me about what I did on Vurbobonc.  I told them all about what happened and what I did.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>This is what happened; a man named Mazeric had told me that a man had stolen a magical device from him and asked me if I could steal it back for him.  He had offered me 500 gold to do it.  Yeah, 500 gold is a LOT of money.  Turned out to not belong to Mazeric after all.  It belonged to the city official that I was stealing it from.  How I found that out was that same city official caught me in the act.  Luckily, I escaped leaving the magical devise.  All of that was several months ago.  I guess that city official really knows how to keep a grudge. <br>
 
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I was set up by Mazeric.  After I was able to get away, I could not find him anywhere. It was almost like he just vanished into thin air.  When I started asking around, no one had even heard of him.  Or so they said.  I am going to find that Mazeric and when I do, he is going to pay.  Next time we go to Vurbobonc I will have to make a point of asking around for information again.  Maybe with Julin�s help I will be more successful than the last couple of times.  Of course, ANY information would make it more successful.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Anyway, on the way back to Hommlet, Rask asked us if we could all stop in the town Duraskien for personal reasons.  We all agreed to rest for a while there.  After stabling the horses, I saw Rask heading toward some sort of graveyard.  Being curious, I decided to shadow behind him to find out what was so personal to make him want to stop in this town now instead of any of the other time we had passed through here.  I followed to a small grave sight with three graves.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>He started talking to the graves.  Turns out the graves belong to his father, sister, and brother.  He first talked to his father, telling him that he was sorry for not being able to protect the family better.  Rask�s father was a Paladin.  Though I had never met a Paladin before, I HAVE heard that they were VERY well thought of and respected.  If I didn�t know any better I would have sworn that I got the feeling that Rask�s father was actually listening to him.  Rask had decided to follow his mother�s path of the clergy instead of Paladinhood.  Then she started talking to his sister.  That was when I found out that I remind Rask of his little sister.  Even now as I look back, I am still speechless about it.  He really cared for her.  He told her that he was NOT going to let me die as he had let her die.  Poor Rask.  He has been through more hardships in his human life than some elves have gone through in their whole life. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I didn�t bother to conceal myself when he turned around from being done.  When he saw me, he asked how much I heard.  I told him I heard everything.  That was when he told me about how his family was killed by an elven vampire.  Only member of his family that was not found was his mother who had been made into a vampire as well as the elven vampire�s bride.  I could tell that this was a great wound in his soul.  He also showed me a scroll containing a prophecy about Rask and this vampire meeting and only one of them living through the confrontation.  Rask also told me that he changed his name to protect himself and those around him.  Maybe a good thing he did.  Seems that I am not the only one that needs to hide their identity.  He doesn�t know it yet, but if I can help it, he will be the one left alive in their confrontation.  I urged Rask to tell the guys about all of this as well, which he readily agreed.  I think that everyone took rather well, considering. <br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I could tell that Numenarh was concerned by this news of the prophecy.  He recognized the name of the elven vampire.  Evidently, this guy was bad seed gone worse.  He had contacted the god Nerull, The Foe of All Good. By sealing a pact with Nerull, he was turned into a vampire.  Ever since then this vampire guy has been rampaging around doing various evil deeds.  Not a nice guy.  I think that we can take him though.  You hear that, Naserul Morlo?  To get to Rask, you�ll have to get through all of US! <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Upon reaching Hommlet, we went to our usual tavern in Hommlet.  As we entered the Welcome Wench, Numenarh stopped so suddenly at the entrance that I bumped into him.  He looked as if he had seen a ghost.  He was staring at a woman sitting at a table, eating.  She had shiny black hair and pretty green eyes. Turned out that the ghost he saw was really his �angel�, Menyoh.  She seemed nice, although a little on the smug side.  Nume introduced us all to her, I think, rather hastily and took her to his room to �propose to her again�.  Yeah, right.  They�re probably� EWW!<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>That when I decided to get myself a large glass of Celene Ruby.  Maybe that would numb the grossness. After finishing my wine Tyro was going to go back to Jaroo�s old place and check it out; I went with him.  We got there and I helped Tyro get into the house since it was now to be Tyro�s home.  I showed him the chest we had found when we came here the first time and he asked me to open it for him.  It had a good bit of money in it.  I told Tyro that I thought the money should belong to him since it came with the house.  He agreed.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After returning to town, I made a point to go by Spuginor�s place to see if he had the potions for us.  Oh, did he.  Got some spider potions and healing potions.  We got a pretty good deal on them, too, since we saved Spuginor�s life.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>When I returned to the tavern, Numenarh and Menyoh were discussing their wedding to be here in Hommlet.  Yea.  Then Menyoh asked me to help her find a nice wedding dress for her to wear.  Lucky me.  And then she asked my help to get a ring for Numenarh to wear.  And yet again, yea me.  Just as I thought that it could not get worse she asked me to be her maid of honor.  I was overjoyed.  I can�t help but like Menyoh.  She�s to darned nice to me.  Darn her.  She has a cool sword though.  It looks like my sword, only thinner.  I hope that I get to see what she can do with it. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>The whole town was abuzz with Numenarh�s wedding.  Julin told stories of our exploits.  From what I hear, he did very well, only for some reason the men of the town either held tightly to their change purses or gave me looks like the men at the brothel did at the ladies that worked there.  Made me a little uncomfortable. That night, they were made into Numenarh and Menyoh Daerkwood.  Julin sang a very nice melody.  Quadro was Nume�s best man.  I just hope that no one saw how miserable I was.  I mean, come on.  Me in a dress?   Didn�t feel right. It was a beautiful wedding though.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I made sure that I got a room far away from Nume and Men�s room, and that is where I am right now.  Drinking more Celene Ruby, taking a hot bath and writing to you to remind you of just how miserable you made yourself today.  But besides all that has happened today, remember to keep your chin up, head held high, and watch everyone be amazed! (At how two people can be happy together.)<br> </font><font size="6">

<p align="left"> 

</font> <p align="left">


<font face="Monotype Corsiva">


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Mental note to self.  Never and I mean NEVER go into a pool of water in an evil place again or touch evil gems!  Today started out with us going back to the Moat House.  Menyoh tagged along, though I thought it was a rather bad idea.  I mean this was their honeymoon.  She wanted to go, though.  I guess to see what all Numenarh had accomplished while he was away from her.  She even said something like �Numenarh wouldn�t do anything that would get himself killed.�  I just looked at Numenarh and smiled.  He was getting nervous.  Good.  Well, anyway, we went to the Moat House to see what we could find with the revealing torch thingy.  We searched that whole place with that torch.  While we were in at the place were that huge obelisk was, I decided to look through a shallow pool of water with the revealy torch and felt my health draining from my body.  By the time I got out, I felt like death warmed over.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>It had been a good while when we found what was hidden that the torch was to reveal.  Where the giant obelisk came down to a point onto the large pedestal, we found a huge purplish gem.  The obelisk was standing on it.  Everyone was trying to figure out how to get the gem out.  I pulled out my long sword and poked it.  Bad idea.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I found myself in a place so dark that I couldn�t even tell when I blinked.  Then I heard a deep voice from everywhere around me say, �Shatter the hearts of the four moons to sunder the walls of my prison.  Eat this fruit so that you may be blessed by me.�  Something cold and round appeared in my hand.  When I asked what it did, I found myself in the room where we had found that cleric and troglodyte with a black apple in my hand.  When I realized where I was, I shouted down as loud as I could for them to not touch the gem.   I heard some commotion down where they were and started to think that they were being attacked.  Then I heard someone behind me and, to my embarrassment, squealed.  It was Quadro with a black apple in his hand as well.  Then Julin appeared.  Were these guys that stupid?  I told them not to touch the gem and that was the first thing they did.  I SORT of understand if it were just Julin, but Quadro, too.   Yeah, I started to fuss at them, telling t!
hem that they were crazed or something.  I yelled down that they were both up here and that I was going to meet everyone at the horses.  I then turned to Julin and Quadro to see that they were putting their apples into their backpacks.  I threw mine down and crushed it with my heel.  I told them that they could do what they wanted to, I was getting the heck out of this place.  I was SICK of this Moat House!<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Upon all of us meeting at the horses, we finally decided to vote for a definite leader.  I said that since I was not a part of the group and my vote should not count.  Everyone looked at me as if I were crazy or something.  Quadro told me that I was indeed a part of the group.  Nume agreed with him.  I cannot express enough how good it made me feel that everyone thought of me in that way.  I mean, the reason that I had not was that everyone else had been introduced AS a part of the group. Not me. I think that it was that they did not feel that they had to tell me that.  I think that I am going to cry.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Julin was apposed to having a leader at all, as usual.  I guess I can sort of see his point though.  But I know from watching Jelanah that it is good sometimes to have someone to end arguments between two people.  �Too many head cooks spoil the stew.� That�s what Jeleket use to say.  At least that is what I want in a leader.  I think that Julin thinks �leader� always equals �loss of freedom�.  I am sure that there are times that may be true, but I do not think that Quadro would turn out that way.  I hope not anyway. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After we decided upon a leader, Quadro immediately decided that we go to the temple proper, and with me still feeling rather unhealthy.  I whined to go back to Hommlet to have the clerics there help me feel normal  and healthy again since Rask had not the spells at the time to do it. Yeah, I whined.  If you felt as bad as I did, you would have whined, too.   Quadro told me that since it would take a few days to get to the temple proper, Rask would have time to help me out.  I guess it made sense and Rask agreed that he would be able to, so I relented.  So here I am waiting for the morning to come so that Rask can do his thing to me.  Until then, I will keep my chin up, head held high, and watch everyone be amazed. (at least someday they will be.)<br></font><font size="6">

<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>First thing this morning after breaking camp, Rask used his magic to make me feel a lot healthier.  Not quite as I was, but close.  He told me that tomorrow he could make me totally better.  That was good news to me let me tell you.  After that, Numenarh sent Menyoh back to Hommlet to wait our return and we continued on to the temple proper.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>On the way there though, we came across the deserted town of Nulb.  Nulb was a proverbial ghost town.  We didn�t know just how literal it was.  Quadro had the great idea, or so we all thought at the time, of looking through some of the buildings to see what we could find of value.  Easier said than done.  Especially when someone doesn�t want you to.  We entered a deserted tavern, them through the front and me from the back.  When I entered the back door I heard everyone start yelling.  I hurried through the kitchen into the main area only to see that Quadro was lying on the floor in the corner and unable to move.  Nume standing over him in a protective manner.  I quickly made my way to Numenarh and asked him what was going on.  He told me that a ghost had attacked Quadro and was now invisible.  I should have taken Numenarh more seriously because, just then, I felt a sharp pain in my back and I felt a coldness move through my body stiffening my muscles to the point of !
being unable to move them.  I felt Numenarh pulling me out of the room.  Man, I HATE being paralyzed.  I�m going to come back and kick that ghosts butt!  While I was lying on by back and paralyzed, I saw an intense flash of light and everyone acting surprised that the ghost was still there.  I knew that Rask was more than likely mad about it.  Maybe Rask and I will come back here and destroy that ghost together someday. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I think that everyone had the same idea that I did.  This was not a good place to be.  We decided that it was a good idea to get out of Nulb as quickly as possible.  At wasn�t long before we reached the temple proper.  You talk about evil.  This place looked like it was build as if to personify what evil meant.  And, of course, if would start to rain.  We all built shelters, although mine was as makeshift as they came.  Julin and Numenarh shared the tent.  I decided to build a fire to keep warm.  I think that Rask is starting to get sick.  <br></font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well that was interesting.  Out of nowhere comes a big glob of mud onto the fire.  It was thrown by a female half-elf ranger named Kella.  She warned us that there were lots of hobgoblins about and people in ocher colored robes.  We told her that the Ocher color robed people were worshipers of the Eye Guy.  She�s gone now so I will need to trance before my watch.  Until tomorrow, Keep your chin up, head held high, and watch everyone be amazed! (at your ability to not catch cold.)<br></font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">Sunday, the Fifth Day of Wealson, 591 cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I know that you will not forget today, Mewn.  Today is truly the first day of the rest of your life.  Death holds no meaning to me now.  You know why, too.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today started with my watch and me hearing some sort of sniffing sound.  I woke Numenarh and told him to wake the others while I investigate.  It was a wild pig the size of a horse.  I tried to hide from it, but it saw me and charged.  It slammed into me, doing a considerable damage to me.  I was so angered by the fact that a pig hurt me, which I did not realize that the others had yelled for me to fall back.  I attacked and in turn was killed by the horse-sized pig.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I cannot explain why I am alive now.  Only that everyone brought me back to the Hommlet�s temple of St Cuthbert to have me raised from the dead.  Am I still dead?  Am I alive?  I do not feel like myself.  Fear gnaws at me every moment now.  Will death come to reclaim me?  I have to find my parents before that happens, so I can find out what has happened to them.  Why can�t I remember what happened to me while I was dead?  Is there nothing after dead?  Is life nothing but strings of a puppet waiting to be cut?  To many questions and not enough answers.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I awoke lying on a cold table and naked with only a white cloth covering my body.  There was some glittery powder all over me.  I realized that I was not breathing and took a breath and started to look around.  That was when Numenarh leaned over me and smiled.  He told me that he made sure and he was the first thing I saw in case I needed to imprint on something, then he smiled.  It was everything I could do to not grab him and hold on to him.  Kiss him.  He is married now.  I almost started to cry but stopped myself and sat up and asked where my clothes were.   <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After getting dressed, I went outside where everyone was waiting.  I was a little taken aback at the amount the amount everyone else�s casualness about what happened to me.  Even Rask, who thought of me as a sister, didn�t show much emotion that I was back from the dead.  What does he know about people being raised that he is not letting us know?  I guess� I hope that it is only because that they want to forget the fact that I died.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After the short reunion, we headed back to the temple proper.  Seeing that place again, though; it seemed different to me now.  It seemed less evil than a place that death dwelled.  I knew that I had to go in there in order to kill the fear within me.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I scouted around the walls of the exterior to see if there were any back ways into the place.  We all entered the courtyard after I scouted the entrance.  After about twenty feet we encountered some hobgoblins and had to fight them.  The encounter did not last long.  Grawl seems less scary to me than he use to.  I don�t understand what is happening to me.  He used to scary me a good deal.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After the battle was done I went to survey the area and found four large hobgoblins guarding the stairs to the temple itself.  I went back to the group and told them what I saw and went back to get ready to attack them.  I got into position over top of them by using one of the spider potions bought at Spuginor�s.  When I thought that everyone was ready, I dropped onto one of them.  Everyone rushed in and we made short work of the hobgoblins guards.  Only one of them almost escaped into the temple to warn the other hobs that we were attacking, that is until Numenarh caught him in the back with an arrow.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Nume told us that he heard voices down the hall.  We all knew what that meant.  They had heard the commotion and were preparing for us.  We continued down the wide hallway flanking each side of it with me scouting ahead on the ceiling.  I didn�t see the two hobs hiding, but they saw the group and took off running down one of the side halls, yelling.  We ran after them since there was no need for discretion.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We came up on a good many hobs and a huge bear looking creature that had feathers instead of fur and it had a beak.  The hobs had a collar on it.  The battle was pretty intense.  It was really hard to take down that bear thing.  It looked like a cross between an owl and a bear.  The last one to fall was the hob leader with I was able to keep from getting away by using the tanglefoot bag.  I always wondered how those things would work out.  Pretty nifty.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I killed the leader of that group of hobs without any remorse at all.  What is wrong with me?  I almost enjoyed killing it.  The blood on my face, a trophy of my victory over death.  I think that the others are getting worried about me.  The look I saw on Numenarh�s face is still with me.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We decide that it was a good idea to check this whole level out before we go to the lower levels.  We found a man on the other side of the building.  First let me remind you what the inside of the temple looked like.  Imagine a straight hallway with a short wide hallway offshooting to each side.  We found the man chained up in a cell on the opposite offshoot that the battle with the hobs and owlbear.  We freed him and decided that Grawl would be the best bet to take him back to Hommlet and come back.  We were going to wait for him to return before we continued on.  I told Quadro and Numenarh that I was going to have a look see around to see what I could see.  Only I found the ones that the man warned us about; three dire apes, two hobs in priest like robes, two hob fighters, a large lizard, and a gaggle of hob flunkies.  Oh yeah, and there were four dogs.  Seeing that they had not noticed me, I hurried back to tell the others and Nume rushed to get Grawl.  We told the!
 man that if he saw that we were losing to get to Hommlet as quickly as possible and find Menyoh.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As soon as we started to prepare for the fight, we heard them start to prepare themselves.  We rushed in on them.  One of them cast a spell I had seen used before. It was called Obscuring Mist.  Then they all started rushing into the mist.  Making it to where it was not possible to see exactly where they were in there.  Julin rushed through the mist.  I then heard him yell out after I heard a loud clicking sound and a flash in the mist.  After a second flash I didn�t hear Julin singing any longer.  I found myself feeled with an acute sense of rage and fired where I saw the flash come from.  I heard the lizard shriek out.   Thinking back, I think that I felt it die.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>This battle was the longest we�ve been in yet.  I heard Rask saying that he was being surrounded, while trying to help Julin, so I rushed into the mist to help him.  I saw a large red flash and heat, then a lot of the bad guys yelling out in pain.  Yea Quadro.  It was all I could do to keep tumbling around while striking opponents.  I then saw Grawl rended to pieces by one of the dire apes.  I do not remember if I screamed out or not.  I rushed at the ape and attacked it.  I must have hit a vital area for I killed it in one hit.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I then rushed back into the fray to help Rask and Numenarh, but was caught by one of the hob fighters and fell unconscious.  When I came to, we had won.  I gained my feet as fast as possible and started to walk to the large hobgoblin intent on killing it.  Nume stopped me and snapped me back telling me that I could have him if he didn�t tell us what we needed to know.  I sheathed my sword and sapped him into unconsciousness.  I then went around to the rest that gave up and sapped them as well.  For good measure.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I looted the bodies and we discovered that they had some really good stuff.  We carted the loot and Grawl body back to Hommlet.  The cleric said that he would not be able to raise Grawl until tomorrow.  So I took some of the stuff to the scroll shot and had him identify some of the items.  <br>


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, that is what happened today.  Falling unconscious that last time shown me that I need to be more careful.  I can cheat death, but I have to be careful in doing it.  As long as you sever the puppet strings of others, Death will not find you.  I cannot let any more of my friends die.  I will help them keep their chins up, head held high, and watch everyone be amazed!  =^_^=<br></font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I learned several things today.  Dwarves are incredibly uncouth and kobolds can have moments of meaningful insights.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today started out with us questioning the hobgoblin adept about the worshippers of the Eye Guy.  As much as I know that it is necessary, it still bores the crud out of me.  So I tried to make it a little more interesting and suggested that I could sap them again if they didn�t cooperate.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I then heard Quadro refer to me as a �he�.  Ok, I know that I am not incredibly good looking or anything, but I DO know that look like a woman, and a noticeable woman at that.  I puffed out my chest slightly and asked if I looked like a man to him.  He then did something that I would have never thought he or anyone of the group would have done.  He grabbed my breast!  I have never been so disrespected in my life!  Even the man that came to Jeleket�s Roost had never done that to me, or to any of the women that WORKED there.  So I slapped Quadro across the face really hard.  I have a mind to tell Jenna about him if I thought that she cared about him.  All I have to say is that he had better not ever do that again.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After listening to everyone discussing what to do with the hobgoblins, I decided to go outside and have a look around.  Tyro wanted them dead, Julin thought that we could have them work for us, and Quadro took the middle ground.  They most have had come to a decision for Tyro had come outside to look around as well.   When we walked around to the back, we found a small building.  I check to see if the door was locked and listened at the door.  Barred and there was whispering inside.  There were definitely goblinoids inside. I signaled to Tyro for him to send Lance, his wolf, to get the others.  I was and still am impressed with Tyro�s companion.  It was not long before the others got to where Tyro and I were.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We tried to talk out the occupants from inside.  Only they would not listen to reason, so we had to force our way inside.  Of course a fight ensued.  On my way in, though, I tripped and fell.  As clumsy as ever, I guess.  The fight was almost pitiful.  By the time I got up we had won.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Again with the questioning.  I don�t know why Julin feels that we need to question every single individual we defeat.  I think that he sometimes talks to hear himself talk.  Julin told them that if they wanted to help us that they would need to join the other Hobgoblins and goblins.  That we were going to pay all of them to inform us when ever the ocher colored robed people returned.  During Julin�s negotiations with the goblins, I again got bored and went outside to check out a tower type structure.  Again Tyro followed me there, as did Rask.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I heard, at the barred door, goblinoid voices.  I suggested to either Rask or Tyro to return to get everyone.  They just looked at me like they didn�t understand a word I said.  Disgusted, I went to get everyone.  When we got back to the tower, we again tried to talk the occupants out and again we forced our way in.  This time Tyro was the first one to rush in.  Only this time they were prepared and they ambushed him.  We all hurried into the fray to help him.  Tyro must have something severe against gobs and hobs.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After there was only one left, they surrendered.  Only Tyro�s wolf was still tearing into the last enemy.  Julin called out to Tyro to have Lance stop attacking the goblin.  Tyro just watched Lance attack the goblin.  He almost seemed like he was enjoying seeing the goblin suffer.   Rask took it upon himself to stop the wolf and rushed it.  I wouldn�t have done that, for I had heard that when two dogs are fighting and you try to stop them, that they would turn on you before they realized who you were.  Instinct or something like that.  Anyway Tyro called of Lance after Rask rushed in to help the goblin.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>For a moment, I thought that Julin and Tyro were going to get into a fight.  There were definite threats made.  Quadro attempted to smooth things over between them.  A discussion broke out about what everyone thought we should do with our enemies that surrender.  Then it happened.  Meepo spoke out.  I don�t think that I will forget what he said and the amount of heart that Meepo has.  He said, �You gave Meepo chance, Meepo want to give goblin chance.� Everyone was stunned into silence at what Meepo had to say.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After a while we started to search the other rooms in the tower.  We found a trap door that led down into darkness.  Quadro, Julin and I climbed down the rungs and looked around.  I was rather surprised that we found a coffer and a locked box along with a hallway that led north.  I scouted ahead about fifty feet before I returned.  After deciding that it would be a good idea to wait until the next day to find out where the hallway went, we climbed back up and set up camp.  I opened the two boxes to find two potions in one and a good bit of money in the other.  We divided up the money and decided to rest for the night and healed up.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>So that is all that happened today.  We still have not raised Grawl from the dead.  I can tell that Nume is getting upset about it.  He clenches his jaw muscles when things are bothering him.  Quadro agreed that tomorrow was the day that we were going to raise Grawl.  He said that yesterday.  But until then, I will attempt to keep my chin up, head held high, and watch everyone be amazed. (At how someone so small can have a heart so big.)<br></font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">Godsday, the Seventh Day of Wealson, 591 cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today started with us following the darkened hallway until it ended at the bottom of some well.  After climbing out we found a small run down cabin that was pretty much in a shambles.  We gathered that there was nothing else to see so we went back to Hommlet in order to raise Grawl.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After reaching Hommlet, Numenarh and Rask took Grawl to be raised and Julin, Quadro and I went to Spuginor�s about some more potions.  I thought that it was pretty neat that Spuginor anticipated our needs like he did.  He had two spider potions waiting for us.  When we were through purchasing the potions we needed, we went to great Grawl back to the world of the living.  So far Quadro, me, and then Grawl have died.  Who will be next?  I hope no one.  It weighs heavy upon my heart to see my friends die.  Death is starting to hold less and less fear within me.  If I die, then my friends would just bring to this place and raise me again, as I will do for them went and if their time were to come.  I am starting to think that Tyro is right in that we need to kill everyone of our foes.  I foresee a vicious cycle with our enemies in that all they will need is one person to be able to raise their friends and they would then attempt to exact revenge upon us.  Grawl seems a lit!
tle on the weak side.  I can sympathize with him on that. I didn�t feel quite myself afterward either.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We then headed to Vurbobonc.  Along the way Julin and I dyed my hair black so that it would be easier to disguise me when we reached Vurbobonc.  Upon reaching there I asked Julin to help me gather information about Mazeric.  Either Julin is the luckiest person alive when it comes to gathering information, or I am the unluckiest.  Julin found out that Mazeric had been in town but has not been seen for a good long time.  He disappeared after stealing a sword that can kill people by just touching them.  Julin called a �nine lives stealer� or something like that.  Anyway, Mazeric had been seen heading south toward the direction of the Temple of All Consumption.  Our next destination.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After gathering as much information as we thought we could without tempting fate, Julin and I when to the magic shop and I bought some slippers that do the same thing as the potions.  Wow.  Now I do not have to worry about the potions wearing off and me falling!  Maybe Nume will like to have the potions to help him with getting better shots at the enemies.  Shooting from the ceiling would be pretty awesome.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I thanked Julin for helping me with getting a lower priced and told him that I was going to check on Jelanah and see if her health was holding out.  Business was as usual, busy.  From the corner of my eye I noticed Quadro heading up the stairs with Jenna.  Again, with the EWW!  When I reached Jelanah�s room, Zhanna and Ailyce were at the bedside caring for her.  Jelanah is not well at all.  I fear that she will not be able to remain alive for much longer.  I whispered to Jelanah that she needed not worry for I could just have her raised.  A sad smile crossed her face and she told me that I was sweet, but I would need to let her go when she died.  All that she would really want would for me to be at her side when she left this world.  I promised her that I would and told both Zhanna and Ailyce that as soon as it seemed if she was getting worse that they were to send a message to a woman staying at the Welcome Wench named Menyoh.  She would be able to get the message to!
 me.  They immediately promised me they would.  I told them that I would return shortly and I told the guys that I was going to stay with Jelanah tonight.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I cared for her as best I could for the short time I will be here.  When I started telling her of my many exploits with the guys, it seemed to give her a sense of strength for she was able to sit up in her bed to listen.  Of course I left out the part of my untimely death and return.  She seemed to enjoy everything I told her; gasping and laughing and clapping at the things I told her. By nightfall, I could tell that she was getting pretty tired so I tucked her in and she smiled at me until she closed her eyes and slept.  I am not ashamed to say that I cried.  I will miss her terribly.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>So this is where I am now, watching over the only mother that I have known.  I cannot help but think how lucky I have been to have Jeleket and Jelanah to raise me.  I have learned so much from them. But most of all, I have learned how to always keep my chin up, head held high, and watch everyone be amazed!<br></font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I swear I think Jelanah just likes to see me squirm.  Before I left Jeleket�s Roost today, Jelanah told me that I needed to hurry up and find me a man to marry and have children.  She winked at me and told me that would mean that I would have to have sex.  She laughed at me when I shivered and said EWW!  After saying my goodbyes, I met with the group and we left for Hommlet.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>When we got there, Numenarh hurried with Menyoh to their room to �talk�.  Yeah, right. EWW!<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We decided that it would be best for us to leave for Rastor tomorrow.  It would give Nume and Men a little bit of time together for it could be some time before we returned.  It will be a ten-day ride there.  So it could very well be a very boring and uninteresting trip there.  So until something interesting happens, I will not be writing for a while.  Until then, I will keep my chin up, head held high, and watch everyone be amazed!<br></font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Wow. Something happened today that I would never have thought possible.  During one of the times we stopped to rest our horses, Julin came up to me and told me that he needed to talk to me about something.  Being curious, I followed him into the woods apiece until we reached a stream and he apologized to me for the way he came across in his room that day.  He said that he had woken up in a bad mood that day.  He assured me that he did not alert the Watch of my presence in Vurbobonc.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I apologized to him as well and told him that I was sure that I did help matters be entering his room without knocking.  I also told him that I was sure that I could have approached the subject in a better fashion.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I think that Julin and I will become friends after all.  At least I hope so.  Julin seems to be starting to warm up to the group.  I think that he, despite himself, is starting to get emotionally attached to us all.  If we can all get to where we are good friends, then I suspect there will be nothing we will not be able to accomplish.  We would all be able to help each other keep our chins up, heads held high, and watch the world be amazed!<br></font><font size="6">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Nothing happened today until we camped for the night. We were almost ambushed by dire wolves.  Numenarh called me out of my trance to get me to wake the others.  I was able to wake Quadro, Julin and then Rask before they came at us.  Numenarh took a massive hit right at the beginning of the fight.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We beat them back, but only barely.  We took a good beating though.  Even though we took the beating we did, we will still keep our chins up, heads held high, and watch everyone be amazed.<br></font><font size="6">

Sunday, the eighteenth Day of Wealson, 591 cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, we almost made it to Rastor before we got a welcoming committee to meet us.  As we rode up the road, we saw a large orc standing in the middle of it.  Nume signaled for me to look into the trees where I saw a bunch of other orcs hiding with bows trained on us.  Their leader called out to us to drop all of our valuables into a pile in the center of the road and we would not be harmed.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Even though these orcs were actually funny, I felt an unnatural hostility toward these orcs.  Julin told them that they were insane, and asked them if they couldn�t tell that we were adventures.  With them being nothing but common thugs they didn�t stand a chance against us.  I mentally agreed with Julin.  Their leader suggested that we show them our power.  Julin fired a pair of those things he calls sonic darts and Numenarh shot his bow, both of which struck the orc soundly.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Limping to the side of the road, he called out to his cohorts to let us through.  I almost started laughing.  Yeah they all left in a hurry after that.  With bruised egos, no doubt.  After that, we made to Rastor without further incident.  Nume told me, after I asked him, that orcs and elves were natural enemies.  That is where my hostility toward orcs comes from, I guess.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Upon entering the town, we headed to the tavern.  There were a few dwarves, but most of the occupants were humans, orcs and half-orcs.  Nume made him way to a cluster of humans and leaned against the wall while Julin talked to the barkeep.  From Julin�s conversation with the barkeep, we learned that Rastor was more or less a town of thieves.  Not a nice place to be at all.  Nume signaled me over to him and covertly suggested that I steal money.  Heck, I thought that it would be a great time for me to test out my skills at pick pocketing again.  It has been a while since I had a chance.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I instantly picked a large half-orc leaning against a wall.  Bad call on my part.  Not only did he catch me, but he also was the bouncer of the tavern.  I think that I was able to convince him that all I did was bump into him.  I surprised myself at how much I welcomed a fight with him.  I all but dared him into a fight after he grabbed my arm.  I do not know where that came from considering that he was at least twice the height I was.  From some reason I was not after of him at all.  I think that the fact that I just wanted to kill him scared me more that fighting him.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Julin jumped in and calmed everything down by calling the half-orc to the bar and offered him a drink.  Even after everything seemed to have calmed down, I still felt as if my hackles were up.  Just then, the same orc that tried to rub us walked into the tavern. Nume walked up to him and told him something.  Whatever he said caused the orc to announce to everyone in the tavern that he had attempted to rob Numenarh and that he was going to buy him a drink.  This confounded Numenarh that no one in the tavern cared that the orc had tried to rob us much less anyone.  I then saw a strange look cross Numenarh�s face as he left the tavern.    After a bit, I grew bored and found a seat.  It seemed that no one cared that there was a gnoll in the room.  Good thing, too, for I would have helped Grawl kick tail.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>It was not long before Nume returned and told the orc to leave town, that he was now the law of the town.  The orc scoffed at Nume and told the barkeep to just let him know when Nume had left town.  The half-orc/bouncer warned Nume that he was fighting a losing battle.  To this, Nume put out an announcement that if there were anyone interested in bring law to the town to show up at the center of town at midday.  Nume then left to do something.  Quadro and Julin decided to go to the scroll shop in town.  I tagged along as an excuse to leave the tavern.  Besides, I wanted to be able to get to Nume�s side if he needed me.  When we entered the Scroll shop, Julin immediately started talking to the owner in order to be able to gather information.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>While Julin was talking to the owner, Quadro suggested to me that I might be able to open the scroll case.  I told him no that it was most likely magically locked and I would be seen.  I think that I remember a time when I met these guys that that sought to �show me the error of my ways�.  Yeah, right.<br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As it turned out, the owner had been to the Temple of All Consumption and had barely escaped with her life.  As had been the only one to escape capture.  She told us of the towers that shot lightning, about some cavern, and about the crater itself.  She also told us that it was said that the caverns were connected to the Underdark.   That caught my attention fairly quickly.  I had heard of the Underdark for men that came to Jeleket�s Roost.  The denizens of the Underdark were called the Drow.  The Drow were said to look like elves only with coal black skin and white hair.  They�re said to be very evil and worship some sort of spider goddess.  I had also heard that they used poison a lot.  So I asked her if she had any potions that would help with poisons.  She said no, but that there was an alchemist named Tal just down the street.  So I left to see Tal, the alchemist.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>On the way, I stopped by the Tavern to tell Numenarh where I was going.  Upon reaching the alchemist shop, I asked Tal what sort of anti-toxins he had.  For some reason though, this man made my skin crawl.  After discussing the types of anti-toxins, he offered me something called Tanbrosh.   He said that it makes a person strike for more damage for a while, only it made you slightly dizzy.  Jeleket and Jelanah told all of their girls to never drink or eat anything that was not prepared in their own kitchen.  In other words, do not take something from a stranger and you have never heard of.  I think that I will bring this Tanbrosh to the Alchemist in either Vurbobonc or Hommlet in order to see what they say about it.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>When I returned to the group, Quadro was just getting the group together to discuss which way we were going to go.  It was under mutual consent that it was a bad idea to attempt to get by the lightning towers.  It was a unanimous decision to brave the caverns to get to the crater.  Quadro said that we would go tomorrow.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After the meeting Numenarh hired someone to build a jail and then went to see who would show up at the center of town.  Julin and I watched from a short distance away in order to keep watch on Nume, just in case he was attacked for what he was trying to do in the town.  Grawl was standing with Nume so we knew that we would have time to get to him just in case.  Only three people showed up; a farmer, one of the townspersons, and, surprisingly, the half-orc bouncer guy.  Nume deputized them and told them that Grawl would be in charge while we were gone.  Nume even wrapped each of their arms with a purple cloth to signify their new role in the town.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Since it was getting late we all decided to turn in for the night.  That is where I am now, in a dingy and cramped room.  I think I saw a cockroach running across the floor.  All I can say is, that I will still keep my chin up, head held high, and watch everyone be amazed.  (And they will if we clean this town up)<br></font><font size="6">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I know that I have said this before, but I must say it again.  Since being with these guys, I have seen things that I do not think that I would have ever seen just staying around Oakhurst and Vurbobonc. <br> 

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We left Rastor that morning for the caverns to the crater.  I think sleeping outside would have been better than sleeping in that place if it were not for the thugs in the town.  Anyway, we headed out. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We decided that it was a good idea to follow the trail toward the crater.  We rode for a good bit and reached the base of a steep hillside that I can only assume was the side of that crater.  We followed the trail, me getting pretty nervous for there was a steep incline to our right and a steep decline to our left.  My nervousness was rewarded by an attack from something both beautiful and terrifying at the same time. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>At first it looked like a giant lion, then I saw its wings.  When it came into full view, I saw that it was about twelve feet long and was covered with thick brass colored scales.  It was almost like this creature was made of living brass.  Even it eyes were of brass.  We didn�t even get a chance to react in any way.  It roared at us and suddenly I couldn�t hear anything but a loud ringing in my ears.  I was deaf!  Thinking that we were going to rush the creature, I tumbled and attacked it.  After we all managed to damage it severely, it flew off and up over the ledge above us.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We waited a little bit to see if it was going to return and attack us.  While waiting, the ringing subsided and we were able to hear normally again.  Seeing that the creature was not going to return, we decided to continue on.  After a bit we came up on a split in the road.  In deciding that the smaller trail to the right was the best way to go and I scouted ahead.  I found a cave with a pair reinforced doors some ten feet in.  Upon inspection I saw that there were arrow slits in the walls of the cave.  Yeah, I went back to alert the others.  We decided to see what the other direction led.  It led to another cave with another pair of doors and more arrow slits.  After some discussion we decided that it would more or less be a better idea to wait for the next day to test either of these entrances. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>So here we are, sitting about a half-mile from the trail.  I hope that tomorrow we do not run into anything like that brass colored thing again.  I cannot wait to tell Jelanah about this creature that Julin calls a dragonne.  I do not know what tomorrow will hold for us, but I do know that no matter what, we will keep ourchins up, heads held high, and watch everyone be amazed! =^_^=<br></font><font size="6">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well today was most likely the most successful, though confusing, day we have had.  Considering that most of us almost died today, that is.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As soon as I had put up my journal for the night, I heard something huge walking around in the woods.  I woke Numenarh and he confirmed it, only that he had heard two things walking around.  I told him that I would go have a look see to see if I could tell what it was while he woke the others.  I was having a severe case of de�ja vue.  I was praying that whatever was in these woods was not a giant pig.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Though I got my wish, I would have preferred the pig.  There were two trolls.  I hid as best I could.  When I saw that they would be able to scent me out no matter where I hid, I took of running for the camp.  I made to the clearing and was able to warn everyone before one of the trolls was able to strike me down.  Though I did not die, I felt that if it were not for my friends, especially Rask, I would have been.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We rested the rest of the night uneventfully and we were able to check out the smaller entrance.  Upon checking for traps and finding none, we entered.  There were two side rooms that turned out to be guard posts.  I disabled the crossbows that were in there just in case the enemy came in behind us and tried to use the crossbows on us.  As we ventured forth, we came upon a room.  I listened at the door and heard some people talking about how they were not getting paid enough. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We talked Julin and Tyro into talking someone out.  Julin brought out an ogre and was talking to him about everyday things.  He then motioned for me to knock him out.  I tried, though I missed.  I got him before he got back to the others, though it was too late.  They heard him and had barred the door.  Numenarh and Quadro busted it in and the fight was on. There were six humans and three ogres in that room.  From the doors on the other side of the room, a human female rushed out wearing half-plate armor, a large shield, a cloak, and brandishing a longsword.  She had to be the leader of these guards.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Two of the ogres gang up on me and strike me down.  Though I was not down for long; I cannot remember for all the confusion on who healed me.  It was either through Rask�s spells or Tyro�s wand.  I remember thinking that I was tired of being the first to fall in these battles we have.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>When I came to, though, more gnolls were rushing into the room, and I saw that we were getting overwhelmed by these temple people.  I feared that we were lost, for there was only Grawl in Rastor to help us and there was no way to get a message to him to let him know.  I thought that there was no force in the world that could help us now.  That was what reminded me of the bead of force in my belt pouch.  I pulled it out intending to use it centered on the leader lady.  In scanning the room I saw that there was no real way to be able to not hurt Numenarh.  When I looked at him in the fight he was looking directly at me, nodding.  He wanted me to use it; he knew why I was hesitating.  I yelled out his name and through the bead.  With it, I cleared one side of the room of enemies, except of the leader lady.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Almost right after my use of my bead of force, I heard the other one being used on the other side of the room, hewing down almost all of the gnolls and humans out in the hallway.  Seeing that the leader lady was trying to get away, Tyro and I blocked her exit to the side doors she was heading toward.  She didn�t give up like most others did when they were the last one left, so we had to incapacitate her.  I noticed that her sword looked a little bit better then mine, so I took it.  After all, she was going to need it any time in the future.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>It wasn�t long after that a man named Fechish came within shouting distance to �parley� with us, as he put it.  We found out the woman�s name was Kallial.  Quadro was able to convince him that we were just wayward adventures that needed shelter and were attacked by Kallial and her guards, and that we were simply defending ourselves.  Somehow, Quadro was also able to convince them that we would work for them as well.  Fechish said that he would pay us to attack the temple of fire, but we had to give back all of the things that belonged to Kallial.  Quadro convinced him to let us keep Kallial�s sword.  I was beginning to think that Julin was either tired to doing to talking or just seeing how far Quadro was going to get into trouble.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Through the periodic visits from a guy named Chess, Quadro had found out that the temples were fight amongst themselves for control of something called the Phanes and the Doomdreamers. Who ever they were.  Quadro also tried to convince Chess into being loyal to us by telling him that he could see me naked.  After Chess left, I climbed down and punched Quadro in the nose as hard as I could.  I told him that he had better not do that ever again.  Next time he disrespects me like that again; I will not be hitting him with my fist.  My sword will talk for me.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>It was several hours before Fechish had sent Chess to retrieve Kallial.  Quadro told them that she was dead.  Chess told Quadro that Fechish still wanted Kallial.  Numenarh suggested to Quadro that they were most likely raising then from the dead.  Quadro told Chess to wait a few moments and went into the small room that everyone was in.  Oh, I forgot to mention that I was on the ceiling via the use of my new slippers of spider climbing.  Chess never thought to look up, thank goodness.  I heard Quadro tell Chess that there was a problem; that in the fight her head had been severed from her body.  I didn�t remember that at all.  As a matter of fact, the guys had stopped me from killing her, saying that she could be questioned.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Chess told them that it didn�t matter; Fechish still wanted Kallial�s body.  I was astonished to see Quadro bringing out Kallial�s body and her head separately.  I was even more shocked, after Chess left the room with Kallial�s body, when Numenarh had told me that he was the one that killed her by suffocated her.  The reason her head was chopped off by Quadro was so that they would be able to raise her; they would have to use a spell called resurrection to bring her back.  Fechish most likely would have to wait until tomorrow to get that spell, according to Rask.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I suggested that I could sneak into Fechish�s room and kill him in his sleep.  Everyone agreed and Quadro cast a spell called invisibility on me from a scroll.  I immediately followed along the ceiling behind Chess, who was carrying Kallial�s body, to a huge room. Chess placed the body of Kallial onto a huge alter.  Fechish and a dumpy looking woman was there two.  When I saw Fechish pull out a scroll, I knew that they were going to resurrect her right now.  I made my way back to the guys as fast as I could and told them what was going on and that we had to work fast in order to stop them.  I didn�t realize until it was to late that the guys had told Tyro go get Grawl.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We had made a tentative plan that was when the guys heard a commotion they were to rush in. When I made it back to the alter room, I saw that they had already brought her back.  By the time I was in position, Fechish was presenting her with a magical sword like nothing I had ever seen.  Just as Fechish was handing Kallial the sword, I pounced.  I landed right behind Kallial and stabbed as hard as I could with my new sword.  I could tell that I dealt a counting blow to her, though it was not enough to kill her.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I was now visible and vulnerable to attack.  Before the guys were able to even get around the corner, I felt my body seize up.  Either Fechish or the dumpy looking woman had cast a spell on me.  Kallial seeing this was able to strike me how ever see pleased.  When she struck me, I felt as if I might could die.  Seeing that I still lived, the dumpy woman whom Kallial referred to as Choronth also attempted to kill me.  All I could think was that there was no way that either of these two was going to leave is fight alive.  I would personally see to that.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>But when the spell at last weakened enough for me to break free, I saw that I had to go after Fechish, for he had cast a spell on the guys to make them confused.  I could kill those two bitches later.  I struck out at Fechish and was able to get through his armor, doing a good bit of damage to him.  I was getting ready to strike him again when I was held in place yet again.  Choronth, it had to be.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I saw Numenarh start to run away just as Rask landed a telling blow that felled Julin.  Things were going very badly for us.  Choronth and Fechish both had summoned air elementals: Fechish by magic and Choronth through the use of some sort of censer.  The larger of the two elementals attacked Quadro, enveloping him.  It also attempted to do the same with Rask.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As I fell unconscious from an attack from behind, I saw Rask running down the same hallway as Numenarh. When I regained consciousness, Quadro was feeding me healing potions.  In seeing that he was also heavily injured, I shirked off my pack and pulled out three of my potions. I gave Quadro my moderate and light healing potions and took the other light healing potion with me, drinking it on the way back to the fight.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I saw that the room was filled with some sort of magical darkness and plunged into it.  Listening very carefully, I could tell that there was someone in front of me and another person approximately beside that person.  I struck out in front of me hitting nothing.  I heard the swish of a blade and a grunt, then Nume�s voice calling out, �My voice.�  So I struck out to the left of the grunt.  From the feel of the blow I struck, I could tell that that I did a severe amount of damage.  From the sound of the cry, I could tell that I had killed Choronth.  One bitch down, one to go. Now to find Kallial and give her my rebuttal.  I didn�t realize until later that Nume had killed her upon his return. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I heard Fechish cast another spell and then nothing.  All I could hear now was Rask battling the larger air elemental, Quadro swinging his axe at something, and Numenarh attacking and stepping forward.  I yelled out for everyone to cover the exits and wait for the darkness to dissipate. Even though no one answered me, I made my through the darkness and tried to cover both exits on my side.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I then saw the elemental coming at me from my right.  After it attacked me, I made for the darkness.  When I came back out of the darkness, though, the elemental was gone.  As I heard Numenarh yelling out that the elemental was attack him, Rask came out of the darkness on my side.  I then yelled for Fechish to give up that we had the exits covered and that there was no escape.  It didn�t take long for the elemental to get to Rask and me.  We dispatched it, even through some difficulty.  Again I yelled for him to give up, that there was no where for him to go nor was there anyone to help him.  After hearing nothing from Fechish, we stood at the exits and wait for the darkness to fade away.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>He was gone.  Quadro said that he had evidently cast a spell to turn into a gaseous form and float away undetected.  Whatever.  At least Kallial and Choronth are dead.  I only wish that I had been able to see the both of them fall.  After making sure that the place was secure, we searched the place for anything of value.  We found some tapestries that upon touching them made Numenarh act strangely for a moment.  Rask then grabbed them and pulled them down for some reason I have yet to fathom. After finding everything that we though could be found we made our way back to the room we had waited in before the big fight in order to wait for Tyro and Grawl to return.  Boy, are they going to be mad they missed the party.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>So hear I sit watching over my friends while they sleep and trance.  Today has almost overwhelmed me.  I have new thoughts to consider now.  Every battle should be fought until the bitter end.  Kill or be killed.  It is a race for the blade that severs ones ties to this world.  I must help my friends to make this world safe against those who would do evil against the innocent.  If we do not then this will end in our destruction.  May the gods help us in this endeavor.  For if the Eye Guy is brought into power none of us will be safe.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Another thought has occurred to me.  We had killed Kallial only to allow her to be brought back to life.  We cannot afford to allow that to happen in the future.  Allowing that to happen would prove our downfall.  I am not sure if I am ready for that, though I got such a sense of satisfaction through killing Choronth and knowing that Kallial was dead.  What sort of evil am I becoming?  I use to hold life in so high regard, now I seek to kill.  I dare not speak of this to the others.  Though they are my friends, I fear that they will not understand what I am going through.  No, I must work this out on my own.  I must keep my chin up, head held high, and watch everyone be amazed.  =^_^=<br></font><font size="6">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Tyro showed up with Grawl fairly early this morning only to find that we had already cleared out the temple.  Both Tyro and Grawl looked a little more than disappointed.  Well, I guess I would have, too, with all the missing of the action and stuff.  We showed them all the stuff that we found and it was agreed that we would go to Vurbobonc to sell what we didn�t want to keep and have identified what we did wish to keep.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Upon leaving the Temple, I had the thought that while we were leaving, I could climb up that cliff and see about the dragonne that we killed in order to see what treasure there might be.  None.  Wouldn�t you know it?  Dumb dragonne.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> So here we are on the road, yet again, on our way to the city that I call home.  I cannot wait to be able to see Jelanah and tell her of our great accomplishment.  It will be a ten day trip to Vurbobonc from Rastor so until then or if something interesting happens before then I will be keeping my chin up, head held high, and watch everyone be amazed.  I wander if the temple will be reoccupied in our absence..<br></font><font size="6">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Well darn it.  We missed Richfest by one day.  Oh well, I forgot with all the fighting that we had been doing that there was even a festival approaching.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Vurbobonc, so many memories both fun and dangerous.  When we arrived here, I went straight to Jeleket�s Roost to check on Jelanah.  I was surprised that Numenarh came with me.  He said that he wanted to meet the woman that meant so much to me.  I was impressed by Nume�s ability to not look at all the women with their advances on him.  I think that he actually made some of them a little angry.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> We entered Jelanah�s room and I checked on her health before introducing Numenarh to her.  She looked worse than she had last time.  I introduced Nume to her and was dismayed at the lack of strength Jelanah had and appalled by Numenarh�s reaction to Jelanah.  He blurted out to her that she was old.  Although I could not tell how Jelanah was taking to Numenarh�s constant remarks of how old she looked, I ushered him out and asked what was wrong with him.  He told he that he had never seen someone that looked that old that the wrinkles were unnerving to him.  I let it go for the time being for I could tell how much it was bothering him that it bothered him.  I know that this will be weighing on his mind, so I will be able to ask him at a later time.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Upon talking with Quadro, I found that we would be staying here in Vurbobonc for three days.  He does not know how much that made me happy, for I will be able to stay with Jelanah and take care of her and we will be able to say whatever we need to say to each other during that time.  Humans have a word that means a great deal to them, that word is closure.  I think that I understand what it is for now and why it is important.  I know that Jelanah will not be alive the next time I return.  She understands why I will have go back to the Temples.  She was and still is a strong woman and will always remain respected by me.<br> 

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> I will not be writing in this journal until we leave Vurbobonc three days hence from now.  Until then I will do what Jeleket and Jelanah have always taught me.  I will keep my chin up, head held high, and watch everyone be amazed.  I know that Jelanah has amazed me. <br></font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Today we are heading back for Rastor.  I loath to leave Jelanah�s side for I know in my heart of hearts that she will be able to live until my next return.  The only reason that I am going to because of what Jelanah had told me the night before.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> She had told me that she loved me very much and that she had wished that I were her daughter if she could have had one.  She told me that she had taught me everything that she could have in her short time on this world and that she was confident that I would be able to make the right decisions, like going to stop those evil people.  She told me that I shouldn�t stay with her because she had Zhanna and Ailyce to take care of her while I was gone.  She told me that I should not feel bad at all if she were to die while I was gone for she was able to tell me now what she needed to tell me and that she was able to let me know how she felt about me and other things.  I will miss my mother terribly. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> It will be nine more days before we reach Rastor again, so I will put this journal away for a time until something interesting happens.  Until then, I will keep my chin up, head held high, and watch everyone be amazed.  Jelanah said that she was amazed everyday with me everyday that she knew me.

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> There were three surprises today; two good only in afterthought, and one really bad.  Upon reaching Rastor today, we discovered that Menyoh was in the town waiting on Numenarh.  She was decked out in armor and weapons to the point that I wandered how she could walk, much less move freely. Well to get to the point of it, she informed Numenarh that she was going to go with us.  Yeah, as you could imagine, this did not settle well with Nume.  I thought that it was a really good joke, until I saw that she was serious about it.  Then I thought that she was crazy.  I said that I thought that she would do nothing but get in the way and get one of us killed.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Quadro started again with his sexist remarks.  I swear that I am really getting tired of that.  If he keeps it up, I will be forced to allow my sword to let him know my displeasure with him.  He will stop these sexist remarks, or I will stop him.  I am through trying to tell him to stop.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Anyway, Menyoh was able to convince Nume and everyone that she was coming with us to the Temples.  I swear I think that Menyoh could have taken lessons from Jelanah in stubbornness; I find it refreshing.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Well, we all went to the Temple; Grawl decided to stay in Rastor as constable.  I think that he was really angered at us for clearing out the Temple of Air before he and Tyro got to us.  But we reached the Temple, and, with me scouting ahead, we found that the door was closed.  Because I thought that we had left the doors open when we left, I became suspicious and decided to check things out.  Upon climbing the wall and listening at the arrow slits I heard orcish voices, on both sides.  I reported my findings back to the rest of the guys.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> It was decided again that Julin would attempt to charm his way in by drawing them out.  It didn�t work.  I could go as far as saying that I think that he ticked them off, for the attacked us right away.  Before we knew it, a huge arrow type thing flew past Quadro.  Julin yelled about them having a ballista and how could they fire a ballista at us.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> I decided to climb the walls and attempt to stab at the orcs through the arrow slits, quickly finding that it was pretty much impossible so I went to attempt the locks on the doors.  After I got it unlocked, Rask ran up to open the doors in order for us to be able to rush in.  And we did, too.  We stormed in like a group of people with a death wish, with Menyoh close behind me for some reason.  I heard Rask�s voice explode in the middle of some gnolls that were rushing into the room from the other direction, stunning them.  It wasn�t long before I heard him do it again. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> I must say that I am fairly impressed with Menyoh.  She rushed in just like I do and she failed an enemy with one hit.  I hope that it was not just dumb luck.  If not then I think that she will get my vote.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Well due to our ability to work well together and the help of Menyoh, We made short order of the opposition.   I was surprised when I saw Chess leading the fight against us.  He mentioned Fechish�s name and took off to the alter room to kill him.  Only he was gone again when I got there.  Damn him!  I will kill him before we are done fighting that Elemental Temples.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> After searching the whole place we confirmed that he was indeed gone.  We decided that it was a good idea to go ahead and start looking though the tunnels to make our way to one of the other temples.  I say we loosely, of course.  Numenarh and I had reservations of this course of action.  Though, Nume was the only one to voice it.  So we went.  It wasn�t long after going through the tunnels, that, again with me doing the scouty thing, we came upon a huge cavern.  As I came to the opening though, I froze.  What I saw in the cavern scared the crud out of me.  I had never even heard any of the men at Jeleket�s Roost talk about anything like this creature.  This golden and tan creature was about twenty feet long and looked to weigh over four thousand pounds.  But that was not the scary part.  The creature had eight heads.  I, as carefully as I could, made my way back to the group and told them what I saw.  Julin said that it was a hydra.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> I could not believe that Both Julin and Quadro were seriously considering us attacking the hydra.  Well we did have to get by it.  So we made somewhat of a plan of attack and went for it.  I was to sneak in behind it while the other attacked it with a frontal assault.  We at least I did a good job sneak around it.  I try attacking and could not get past the darn thing�s hide.  I saw Numenarh take a hit from all of its heads and fall.  It did the same thing to Tyro when he went to cast a healing spell on Numenarh, failing Tyro.  Good thing Menyoh pulled him to safety.  We barely beat it.  At least I took no damage from it, but I dealt none to it either.  How embarrassing.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> After beating the hydra I saw something else that liked to have made me wet myself.  Tyro turned into a bear!  Yeah, I screamed.  I really dislike druids.  They�re weird.  I found out later that he turned into a bear to rest and because it kind of heals him in a way.  After I got myself calmed down from Tyro�s transformation, Menyoh, Nume, and I found a huge secret door that was about twenty-five foot across.  We all decided that it was a really good idea if we were to rest.  The fight with the hydra had drained a lot of our resources.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> So that is where I am right now, resting and writing.  Tomorrow will be a better day.  I just know it.  It has to be. I would love to be able to tell Jelanah of the hydra, though I know that she will not be there upon my return to Vurbobonc.  Well, Jelanah, I am doing it.  Living the fight for the dream.  I will always keep my chin up, head held high, and watch everyone be amazed!<br></font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">Godsday, the Fourteenth Day of Reaping, 591 cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Today rather sucked for me.  Not only did I almost die, but I found out something about Rask that rather distresses me.  The day started with us going through that huge secret door and finding our way to a huge cathedral type room that had six rooms, three on each side, in it.  We searched each of those rooms only to find out that they were all empty.  Not a thing in them but junk.  Which meant that we would have to go the other way.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> When we came up on a huge door, I searched it for traps and barely found one.  It was an incredibly well made one.  When I was told to disarm it, I though myself at least lucky that the trap was not a magical trap.  Everyone backed away while I attempted it.  Like I said before, I was lucky to have just found the trap; I wasn�t as lucky with disarming it.  I had just enough time to look up and see the ceiling collapsing down on top of me, almost crushing me to death.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> I do not know how long it took them to dig me out, but it felt like forever.  It felt as if every bone in my body had been broken.  I asked Rask to use his healing magic on me and he acted like I was out of line for even thinking to ask him.  He acted very put out.  Well, all I have to say is that if he acted like this with his sister, I do not wish for him to think of me as her.  I thought that it was a compliment.  Evidently not.  I know that I will not be asking him in the future, for I cannot rely on him. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> After we made it into the room, we found that it was actually a treasure trove.  Not only did we find three chests with six thousand gold in each but we also found an extremely well made statue of the dwarven god named Moridin.  This was a hidden area of these dwarven mines the temples had not found yet.  This was very exciting.  To think how the dwarves would react to us bringing their statue back to them would be worth all the gold that we found here to me.  They would be so appreciative that they would most likely have a feast in our honor.  That would be so amazing!  But Quadro, for some reason didn�t want to hear any of it.  He didn�t like the idea it seemed at all.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Anyway, there was so much gold and things that everyone was worried about it being gone if we left it there.  We couldn�t all take the cache to Rastor for Grawl to watch for that would like painting a target on his back for all the cutthroats there.  We couldn�t very well go all the way back to Vurbobonc for that would be a total of twenty days wasted in just hauling our find to Vurbobonc and getting back.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Rask said that he had a spell that allowed him to reshape stone and rock.  That with this spell he could make a hole in the side of the wall large enough to put it all in and seal it back.  Tyro said that he could take the gold and shapechange into some kind of bird, while holding the gold, and fly to Vurbobonc and it shouldn�t take much longer than a week.  Quadro told Tyro to do that and handed him stuff to enhance and a list of things to bring back.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> And that would conclude the day.  Right now we are waiting for Tyro to return with everything.  It should take him about a week.  Until then, while we wait for his return, We will keep our collective chins up, heads held high, and watch everyone, that opposes us, be amazed.<br></font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Finally Tyro returns and bearing gifts!  I cannot remember what everyone got, but I know that Numenarh and Quadro got their armors enhance.  I got a magical backpack called a Heward�s Handy Haversack.  An incredible thing, no matter how much I put into it still only weighs about five pounds.  I like it.  Quadro also made sure that he had more beads of force.  Giving one to me and one to Numenarh to keep since it worked so well last time we needed them.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Tyro asked us all if we minded allowing him to rest a day before we continued on.  Quadro didn�t seem to like this idea but relented after we all expressed our concerns for Tyro.  I think it was only That Quadro was getting impatient from sitting around and waiting.  I know that I was.  But still, Tyro is one of us and I know how I felt when with Rask�s expression of displeasure in my wanting him to heal me a week ago. So we will rest one more day for Tyro. Until tomorrow, we will keep our chins up, heads held high, and watch everyone be amazed.<br></font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">Earthday, the Twenty-Third Day of Reaping, 591 cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I do not know how long we have until we try and enter the Fire Temple, so I will write what I can now for I do not know if I will have the time tonight. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today was not one of our better days let me tell you.  If we work together like we did today, we will surely die when we confront any of the other temples.  So far I feel that our karma is what has allowed us to survive this long; it will not last much longer.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> When we were all awake this morning, we immediately started to search farther along the tunnels.  It wasn�t long before we found an emerald hanging from a silver chain.  As per usual Julin felt that he had to touch it and was almost overwhelmed with confusion.  It was agreed that I should climb up the ceiling to where the chain was attached and unfasten it. I did so, even though I thought that there was a good chance that the enchantment would be on the chain as well.  Karma had stepped in again; it wasn�t.  So now we have a diamond that looks to be worth around a thousand gold. We kept the chain as well.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Later we found a room where it appeared that priest of Moridin would get dressed for their ceremonies.  We found some incense and something that Quadro called Thunderstones.  I was amazed at the amount of time and thought that the dwarves must have put into making these rooms.  It angered me to see what the Temple of Elemental Evil minions have done.  They WILL pay for what they had done and pay dearly.  The dwarves will have their home back.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> The very next room was rather interesting in the fact that there was a huge anvil close to the center of the room only it was a little farther to the other end.  Behind it was a stair hallway leading down.  As we entered the room, though, a huge statue started coming up from the ground next to a wall.  The statue turned out to look like a huge dwarf about ten to twelve feet tall and just about as wide.  I rushed out of the room and it closed the doors with Quadro still in there.  As it turned out it only comes to life and attacks those that are not dwarven.  Pretty clever in my opinion.  In seeing that it moves rather slow, I decided to try and distract it while the others ran for the stair hallway.  It worked sort of.  The darned thing seemed to be able to figure out what I was trying to do and closed the door.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Well it took some thinking, but we figured out that if we just took off for the stair hallway, we could probably make it.  So it happened, they made for the stair hallway.  Only bad thing was that Numenarh and I both saw that Meepo wasn�t going to make it.  Nume ran to confront the statue before it attacked Meepo and I ran to the other side in order to attempt to distract it.  It struck Numenarh and I heard his shoulder crunch from at least twenty feet away.  Both Numenarh and Meepo made it to the hallway.  When I checked to see where the statue was so that I could figure out where to run to, I saw that it was upon me.  This thing moved a little faster than I thought.  I defended my ribcage by crossing my arms in front of me as it struck me.  The force from the blow alone flung me against the wall knocking the breath out of me.  I was able to get to the hallway in time before it was able to strike me again.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> After Nume and I were healed up, we all continued forth and found a room that had five delicate looking spheres on an alter looking table.  Julin again immediately went over to one and grabbed it up, got a strange look on his face, and gently put the sphere back.  Julin told us that we shouldn�t take these things for they belonged to this place and that it would be wrong to take them.  Nume and I both looked at each other and nodded in agreement that Julin was definitely charmed.  It wasn�t the fact that he said that the spheres belong to this room; it was the fact that he said it was wrong to take them.  I think that only Rask and Quadro didn�t know that Julin was charmed.  Heck, I thought that it was rather evident. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Well, for some reason, Quadro felt like he just had to have one of those spheres.  Julin warned him that the spheres were going to stay where they were, even if he had to fight Quadro and everyone to ensure that he would.  Quadro didn�t listen, of course, and went for one of the spheres.  So, true to his word, Julin attacked him with his rapier.  Seeing this Rask cast a spell on Julin that held him in place, which made me wince due to what happened to me in that fight with Fechish and his cronies.  Rask�s spell held Julin in place while Quadro grabbed up one of the spheres for himself.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Now here is where it gets really stupid, Mewn, and when you look back on this moment you will laugh yourself into tears, I think now, every time.  I can only guess that not wanting to be left out, Rask grabs one up as well.  Then Quadro grabs another, because, I guess, he felt that he had to have more of the spheres than Rask did.  Well, here it goes.  Quadro gets the funny look going over HIS face now and agrees with Julin that it was best to keep the spheres here where they belonged.  Again, Nume and I looked at each other and nodded knowingly to each other. Yep, Quadro was charmed now, too.  We knew Quadro was charmed only for the fact that he agreed so much with Julin in a syrupy way.  Quadro told Rask to put his back as well.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> This didn�t set to well with Rask, and seeing that the spell on Julin had warn off, decided that it was best to make for the door with the sphere.  Yeah, he just took of running.  Well, Quadro took off after him and tackled him at the door, Julin not far behind.  Rask started calling out for someone to help him as Julin started trying to take the sphere away from him.  I was not about to get in the middle of that for I knew that all that would happen would be that me getting hurt and then me killing someone.  So I chose to wait and sap who ever decided to turn this little drama into something ugly.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> After Julin and Quadro had wrestled the sphere free from Rask and returned it to that alter, Rask went into a tirade about how he was not going to help any of us when we got into trouble.  With that comment, Rask has just earned his second mark from me.  A third will result in unpleasant results.  Jeleket and Jelanah both have taught me that everyone deserves at least two chances to be in your life.  I decided on three since my lifespan is longer than any humans�.  Throwing that ring away like he did that time was the first.  This is the second.  Hopefully there will not be a third.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Numenarh evidently thought the same thing for he walked up to Rask and directly warned him that if he did find himself in that situation that Numenarh, himself, would make sure that Rask would leave the group.  Rask yelled at Nume that if that happened Nume would be leaving the group, too.  I just about stepped in to say how lame that sounded when Nume started to explain to Rask why we didn�t help him.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Think that the stupidness is over yet? Wrong!  After Nume was finished talking to Rask, Rask immediately cast a spell he calls sanctuary on himself to make it to where people cannot attack him and goes to grab another sphere.  I saw a look of, I can only describe as, so-thereness before something happened that I really am having a hard time describing.  It looked sort of like Rask was made of wax and was melting, only the melting wax was remolded into another form.  The form that Rask had been turned into was a DWARF! <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Everyone was in stunned silence for mere moments before Menyoh and I screamed from being startled.  Then everyone started laughing.  It was hysterical!  Well, it was for us.  Rask didn�t think that it was too funny.  I thought of it as a sort of just rewards.  I mean if we can get him turned back of course.  If we cannot, then it will be rather bad. I tried to console him by reminding him that the vampire in his prophecy was looking for a human and not a dwarf.  It seemed to cheer him up, though only a little bit.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> After everyone composed themselves, we continued on to the next room.  Upon entering, we saw a huge emerald, only when Meepo detect the magic on it he told us that there was illusion magic on it.  We left it alone.  Especially since touching things here can get you turned into a dwarf.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> It was not much farther down the tunnel when we found another door.  Of course it was trapped you know it was.  And as usual I was required to attempt disarming it.  Only it looked as well made as the trap that made the ceiling fall in on me.  Not that lucky; it was a pit trap.  A deep trap. With spikes.  Before I blacked out I leaned my head up to see that three spikes had found their way through my body; my right shoulder, my left leg and just below my ribcage to the left a little.  Seeing the spikes caused pain to course through my body.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> I woke up with Quadro leaning over me from feeding me a healing potion.  I am really starting to hate traps.  At least their were some great looking thieves tools down there, along with a strange looking ax and some very well made crossbow bolts that were giving to Julin.  After I was able to climb out, I put a knot on one end of my rope, notched it into the door jam, and through the other end to the others so that they could get across.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> The tunnels on the other side of the trap were rough stone, unlike the worked stone of the dwarven tunnels.  I scouted ahead again and heard orcish voices ahead.  That could mean only one thing.  We made it to one of the other temples, most likely the Temple of Fire.  I ran back to the others and told them what I heard.  Quadro, the now dwarfenized Rask, and I, after drinking the potion that bestows darkvision, headed back to the orcish voices while Nume and the rest brought up the rear using the everburning torch.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Instead of going through the whole battle, I�ll just remind you of what we found out.  It turned out that these orcs were fighting the worshipers of the Eye Guy every chance they got and thought that we were with the Temples.  It didn�t help our potion much that we were wearing the Temple of Air�s amulets.  After we convinced them that we were actually against the Temples as well, we talked them into helping us out by keeping the Temple of Air cleared out.  They gave us a map and their password in return for us not looting their stores.  Of course we agreed.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> So we made our way to the entrance of the Fire Temple.  And that is where we are right now, waiting.  I am leaning against the wall right now, writing.  Tomorrow is going to be a really bad day, I can feel it.  There is no telling what is going to happen.  I feel Death close by tugging in my puppet strings.  Something tells me that Fechish was able to warn the Temple of Fire for our arrival, so this could get really bad.  I know one thing though, those in this temple will see that our chins are up, out heads are held high, and they will be amazed at our abilities..  =^_^=<br></font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> That day did not bode well.  I was killed by a gnoll using a great axe.  As to whether or not I am glad that Julin and Rask brought me back to Vurbobonc to be raised from the dead, I do not know.  Out of respect, I went with Rask the Dwarven Destroyer of Evil to accompany him to be polied back to human.  I am starting to see that Magic is very important.  I will have to find a way to use it.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> After I was done accompanying Rask, I went to check on Jelanah.  I was told by Zhanna and Ailyce that Jelanah had died seven days ago.  Two things bother me; that her death does not bother me as much as it should, and that she died most likely on the same day as me.  Zhanna and Ailyce have take care of the arrangements and have assured me that Jelanah will have a burial fit for an honored member of Vurbobonc, just her mother did.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> After leaving Jeleket�s Roost, I went to find Julin who was selling the remaining items.  With Numenarh�s portion to buy him a magical quiver called a Quiver of Ehlonna.  It will allow him to carry a greater amount of arrows.  Not sure what all else it can do, but I am sure that Numenarh will be happy with it.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> I would say that I will keep my chin up, head held high, and watch everyone be amazed but until these elemental temples are destroyed, I cannot do that.  I know that Jeleket and Jelanah would not approve of my thinking at this moment, but they will just have to understand.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> We leave to return to the temples in the morning and to our comrades who are hopefully still alive.  It will be another seven days before we make it back to the temples.<br></font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Today Rask, Julin, and I were attacked by two hippogriphs, or that is what Julin called them.  We thought, at first, that they were Pegasi.  Julin remembered that he had found out that there is a command word for an ability my Sword of Air has.  I used it and, well, to say the least, I like this sword a lot more now than I did.  When calling out the word �hisah�, the sword released a swirling blast of air, striking one of the hippogriphs.  After managing to kill one of them, the other flew away.<br></font><font size="6">

<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> To better explain what has happened to me, I need to go back to the day we returned to the Temple of Fire on  Waterday, the Eighth Day of Goodmonth, 591 cy.<br></font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Upon reaching the entrance to the Air Temple, Julin apprized me that the Fire Temple had taken it over.  We managed to convince them that we were to be new recruits for the Air Temple but in seeing that the Fire Temple was in charge now, we wished to work for them, instead.  We were lead to the leader of this extension of the Fire Temple, a rat-man sorcerer, who gave us the conditions of our employment and told us that we would be making a gold piece a day.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> We were then sent to see someone else to get our assignments and our Fire Temple medallions and told us what the password to get by all of the checkpoints.  While the guard wasn�t looking, I pocketed enough medallions for our companions when we reached them.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Using the password, we were able to make it them.  As we walked up to them, I saw Numenarh sitting against a wall holding Menyoh.  When I got closer to them I saw that she had died.  I called out her name in surprise.  Another was dead at the hands of these worshipers of evil.  I knew even without looking at Nume, how he must be feeling.  He didn�t say anything to anyone, he just sat there holding Menyoh�s body and slightly rocking.  I went over to him to offer him what ever solace I could; I knew that there would be nothing that I could say that would offer any solace at all.  Quadro had described what had killed her.  Julin called it a githyanki; an ugly evil creature to hear it from Quadro. From the amount of distain in Nume�s eyes, I could tell that if we were to ever meet up with it again, I or anyone for that matter had better not get between him and this githyanki.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Julin pulled out a letter and told Numenarh that it was a letter from Menyoh. Evidently she had given it to him to read to Numenarh.  Well, that is what he said.  Julin opened it and began to read it to himself before reading it out loud.  He then handed it to Quadro for him to read it for he was not good at anything �mushy�.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> I could tell that she loved him very much from the words she used in her letter to Numenarh and her wish for him to continue on.  She had told him to not let even death stop him.  From the anguish on Numenarh�s face, I could see how much he loved her.  It hurts my heart to see him in this much pain.  After learning that Menyoh did not wish to be brought back from the dead, we gave her a moving burial ceremony.  Rask used a spell to move the rock floor out of the way and made a grave for her.  Nume placed her gently in the ground. Then Tyro used the same sort of spell that Rask did to cover her up.  Julin sang the song he sang for their wedding for her.  Quadro chiseled out a small grave marker.  Meepo and I did nothing, regrettably.  I knew not what I could do.  So I silently sword to Menyoh that I would watch over Numenarh for her. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> When it was brought up about a plan of attack, Numenarh immediately stood up and started heading in the direction of the main Fire Temple.  It was discussed on the way on how we should attack.  By the time we had reached the entrance, we had decided that Julin, Rask, and I should enter first seeing as how we were not with them when they were attacked the last time. Julin attempted to disguise Nume, Quadro, and Meepo.  Tyro turned into a bear again.  I will not get use to that, ever.  I also saw that Lance had changed.  Quadro said that Tyro had turned him into a Dire Wolf.  Tyro could ride him as a mount now, I think.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> After Julin, Rask, and I made it past the front guards we continued on a small distance and waited.  We heard Quadro knock and being let in.  I saw Quadro bury his axe into one of the guards, killing him instantly.  The fight didn�t last long enough for them to even call out.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> I scouted ahead and found, in a side room, a woman chained up against a wall.  She looked like she was an elf, only she had green skin and she was bald.   After I asked her who and what she was, she told me that her name was Celeste and that she was an Aasimar.  I was at a loss as what to do with her so I let her go so that she could at least defend herself.  She asked for a bow and some arrows.  We gave her a longbow found on one of the gnolls and same with arrows.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Further on down, I heard snoring of something big in another side room.  It was a sleeping hill giant, there was also a sleeping dire wolverine.  I was itching for some pay back for what they did to Menyoh, Numenarh, and me so I killed the hill giant in his sleep.  Unfortunately, I woke up his pet in the process.   It didn�t have time to hurt anyone.  I should say poor thing.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> After more investigating, we came up on several human complaining about their wages.  Posing as members we entered the room to find that they were getting ready to pay a game of chance.  Quadro and I sat down to join them while Nume, Rask, Julin and Tyro took to the corners of the room.  We took them by surprise and took them out before they even knew what hit them.  Good riddance to bad rubbish, I thought.  Julin, thought differently, though.  Patching all of their wounds so that they would not die.  Whatever.  Better them than me.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> As we continued on, we found a huge stone bridge with two mean looking hill giants guarding it.  We approached with care and Julin attempted to charm them.  We found out that it didn�t work by them attacking us because we didn�t have someone called the Grand with us.  This battle was a lot more difficult than the others we have faced since arriving here.  During the fight, we lost another member of our group.  Lance.  I had mixed feelings about Tyro�s reaction to his death.  It bothered him, only it didn�t.  I am not sure what I think out that or Tyro.
<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Still continuing on, I heard two brutish voices telling the other he was more stupid.  I, getting use to impersonating members of the Fire Temple, walked right in.  I was noticed right away by the Minotaur who pointed me out to the Troll.  I showed them my fire medallion and they relaxed some.  I almost was able to get them to fight each other, that is until they remember what the Grand had told them about fighting each other.  That was bad, a Minotaur and a Troll scared of one person.  He must be one bad fellow.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Julin and Rask entered a few moments after I noticed a halfling female chained against the wall looking rather battered.  I walked over to her and whispered to her that we were going to get her out.  I could tell that Slaad, the troll, and Cutis, the Minotaur, were getting restless with people just walking into their room.  Just then, the unimaginable happened.  Quadro walked up.  Either he was not, at all, thinking correctly, or he just got a case of the stupids.  He should have know straight off that either one of them would have recognized him.  After what Quadro told me about their battle with them, I think that I would remember.  After all, he was the only dwarf in their battle last time.  Sometimes, I wonder if he only has brains in the head between his legs.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Of course, they go to attack him, and, of course, I have to try and stop them.  After everyone made it into the room, I took the lethal blow from the Minotaur that brings me to now.  From what I understand, I was pretty much cut in half with but a single blow from him.<br></font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> So now we are in someplace called Nyr Dyv, where I have been, what I have had described to me as, truly resurrected.  This was different from being raised.  I didn�t feel at all drained of energy.  I hurriedly donned my armor to go back to the Fire Temple, but was informed the Quadro wanted us to stay here in Nyr Dyv for about eight days.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> I for one think it a bad idea.  Not only will the troll and the Minotaur be raised or even truly resurrected, but they will be ready for us next time.  The passwords that we have now will no doubt be changed.  It will be harder to gain entry next time.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> I immediately went to sell the necklace of fireball I bought in Vurbobonc and bought myself a wand to heal myself.  I know that I am now indebted to all of my friends to a point that I cannot repay.  I must try though, for if I cannot then I am nothing more than a hindrance to them.  I think that shall tell them to not bring me back next time.  They need not waist their money on getting me brought back from the dead.  I shall endeavor to make it to where they will not have to, though I still fell as if Death is not through with his sadistic cutting.<br></font><font size="6">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Today I find myself alone.  By choice or by fate, I am uncertain.  Numenarh is learning from Celeste new ways of using the bow.  Julin has taken refuge on a small island in the lake outside of Nyr Dyv.  Tyro and his newly acquired dire wolf companion named Luke are out in the woods somewhere.  Rask is in one of the temples praying or whatever they do at temples.  Quadro is like a child in a candy store going from magic shop to scroll shop learning whatever he can get his hands on.  Meepo is with Numenarh.  Me.  I have found myself wandering the streets, looking at things in the types of shops that I have never cared to look in before.  I have never thought that dresses suited me. <br> 

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Tonight is really the first time I have had the time to sit back and think about what all has happened to me since I met these guys. Having known them for four months now, I feel as if they are my family.  I have no one now.  My father and mother may be dead, and I never had a chance to know them.  I have to try and find them.  At least find where they are buried if they are dead.  I need to go to Celene.  My homeland.  Maybe I have some other relatives there.  Maybe I AM truly alone.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> Enough of this.  Tonight, I will go out and have some fun.  I feel like some Celene Ruby with some roasted vegetables or something.  Goodnight, Mewn �Stacia Nailo� Riverflow.  You will find your destiny.  Or will it find you? =^_^=<br></font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, Things are starting to look for us, I think.  Julin�s people skills are coming in very handy.  Wish he could use his people skills with us.  Then again, maybe not.  I might find myself out of a few things.  What Julin found out was that there was cultist activity in Dyvers.  He found out that the Censer and Horn of Air that we had sold to a merchant back in Vurbobonc was in route to Greyhawk City on a barge when the barge was attacked.  The only things stolen were the Censer and the Horn.  That wasn�t all Julin found out either.  Fechish was in Dyvers and was attempting to get up a gang of mercenaries to go and reclaim the Temple of Air.  Finally, I can live up to my promise to myself that I would kill him.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Oh yeah, and Fechish was working with the local thieves guild.  That was bad.  I have had attempts of thieves guilds recruiting me in the past.  I barely escaped with my life all five times.  When a thieves guild comes to you to recruit you, you say no at the risk of your life.  They do NOT like the answer no.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After some deliberation amongst the group, we decided to try and infiltrate their ranks by getting hired to fight for them.  When we entered the bar that we were to meet our contact, Quadro sent Numenarh to talk to the man.  I have seen men more pale than this one, but they were dead.  The conversation between the pale man and Nume appeared to go well, that is until we left and overheard another man talking to the pale guy saying that we were good.  Well that was the end of that idea, so we went to our secondary plan.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Tyro turned into an owl and flew after the pale guy to see where he went.  When Tyro returned, he told us about where the pale guy had gone and how to get there.  I found out that where tyro had followed the pale guy to, was the local thieves guild.  Yeah, I was rather nervous about going, but what we have to do is so much more important than just one person�s feelings about something.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We went to the thieves guild and find that it was built over a bridge.  There was a ladder leading up to a trap door, which Quadro readily started to climb.  Just as I was getting ready to tell him that it might not be a good idea, he opened the trap door and was attacked by a few rogues guarding that entrance.  Luckily Rask was right behind him and caught Quadro before he fell.  I ran up one of the beams to attempt to fire at one of them, but they closed the door before I had a chance.  As Rask climbed down and healed Quadro, I went to go and check the windows.  After I found an open window and climbed in, I threw a rope for everyone to climb up.  I could feel a layer of silt or some powdery substance on the floor but didn�t pay much attention to it.  I figured that it was just a lot of dust.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I pulled out my everburning torch and handed it to Nume for Meepo to carry.  Now hear is how smart I am.  I open the door and look out.  Immediately, we are spotted because there were no light sources in whole darned place.  So we charge in.  Now I should have realized that there had been a reason that there were no light sources, but I didn�t.  As we were fighting, suddenly everything went totally dark.  I thought that Fechish had cast it just like last time.  Nope it was some bitch-lady that cast it.  Well into the fight, I heard Meepo cry out.  It wasn�t much later the there was an explosion.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I heard yelling and crashing timbers.  Rask yelled to me that they were trying to get out through the trap door.  I tumbled over to the trap door and closed it.   Then I started to feel the heat.  I opened it back up to allow Nume and Rask to escape through the trap door.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Upon making it out and forcing a few rogues to jump into the river, Nume went over and picked up a dead Meepo and glared at the bitch-lady.  I didn�t hear what they said to one another, but the look on Nume�s face made her jump into the river, as well.  Little Meepo.  The smallest of us, but with the biggest heart.  Rask went up to Numenarh and told him that we still have a scroll with the spell to raise him.  Nume told him to use it, but would let go of Meepo.  So Rask used that scroll on Meepo while Meepo was in Nume�s arms.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>The scroll sort of made a small explosion into diamond dust and swirled around Meepo�s body.  Then Meepo took a raged breath and asked what happened.  Nume told him that he had been knocked unconscious.  I think that I am growing more and more callous.  The only thing that I felt when I saw that Meepo was dead was anger and a need for revenge.  This was ultimately Fechish�s fault and I will see to it that he dies for it.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After we made our leave of the area, Nume was asked to track bitch-lady.  It took several hours, but he found where she had gone.  Some sort of warehouse.  After seeing her enter, he had made his way back to us.  It was decided that we should rest for the night.  That is where I am tonight.  Resting and wandering how long it will be before I get to kill Fechish.  It is time for him life strings to be cut.  Too many of my friends are dying.  Yeah they are being brought back and that is great.  I wonder if they get the same feeling that I had this last time.  A feeling of familiarity only not.  It�s hard to put into words.<br>

Moonday, the Twenty-Seventh Day of Reaping, 591 cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today has brought me a form of closure.  First thing this morning, after Quadro and Rask prepared for the day with spells that they were going to use, we set out after the bitch-lady.  We made it to the warehouse where Nume had tracked her, and entered carefully.  We searched around and found that an empty crate was cleverly hiding a trap door leading down.  Rather clever actually, a rope was attached to the crate to pull it over the trap door after going down.  After finding not traps in the door, I opened it.  Again with the acid traps.  I swear, one of these days I am not going to be lucky enough to get out of the way.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We made it down the ladder and found a door.  Again I didn�t find traps, but I was confident this time that I had looked well enough to be sure.  I opened it and was attacked by two guards; one of which yelled out that they were being attacked.  Through a door on the other side of the room I just entered come three large ogres, a dwarf, two humans, and that pale looking guy from the bar yesterday, only now I could see that his eyes were glowing red.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Through the ensuing battle, Rask fell from being hit by the pale guys fists.  I have never seen anyone fight like that before.  He uses his hands and feet like they were weapons.  Impressive, but not enough to get by through us.  I was able to use the healing wand of Rask to keep him alive.  I could tell that I had gotten to him only just in time.  After a bit, the pale guy tried to escape but I was able to stop him, although barely.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Nume tied him up, and we started to discuss what to do with him.  I knocked him out cold and took everything of value that our beaten foes had and stuck then into my Haversack.  That was when we heard an explosion coming from the other room and sounds of combat.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After climbing down we saw Fechish, and some mage guy along with their flunkies fighting the bitch-lady and her rogues.  I saw Fechish cast a spell on bitch-lady, we found out later that her name is Minaj, and from the effects of it I could tell that it was a hold person.  The same spell that he tried to kill me with; him and Choronth.  We stormed in and took them both by surprise. I attacked Fechish right off, while Nume, Quad, and Rask took care of the mage.  Julin and Tyro hurried in and helped me with Fechish.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We beat Fechish and company fairly easily and learned from Minaj that she wasn�t going to give Fechish the Censer and Horn she stole for them after she found out that they were trying to destroy the world.  After talking with this woman, I have a certain amount and kind of respect for her.  I hope that she and my paths cross again, only as allies, though.  We tied up everyone that was aligned with Fechish and helped out everyone that was aligned with Minaj.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After being asked, she gave us the Censer and Horn.  I had found five hundred gold on Fechish and, in agreement with Nume, gave it to Minaj seeing as how she had completed her task for them.  After all, They should pay their dues.  Just like Fechish paid his due to me when I walked up to his unconscious self and killed him.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I never knew that revenge could make a person feel this empty.  I still have the anger within me.  I thought that killing Fechish would release a lot of that anger.  After all, it was he who contributed to most of it.  I feel no solace in killing Fechish, yet I am glad that I killed him.  Numenarh was the only one that saw me kill him and he came up to me and told me that I was wrong in killing him simply for the fact that we may have been able to get information from him.  All I could do was shrug to him and then I told Nume I would now help him kill the bitch that killed Menyoh.  I saw a flash of anger go through Nume�s eyes, not at me, at the remembrance of the person that killed Menyoh.  No one else even wandered why I killed Fechish or even who killed him. I guess they understood why I did it and had rathered not bring it up.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Now we are back in Dyvers.  We decided to sell the things we found tomorrow.  Right now I am going to go and take my bath and trance, then I will go into the common area and sit by the fire to think about things.  G�night, Mewn.  I hope that things have turned out well for you despite everything that has happened to you in your life. <br></font>

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today we head back for Rastor in an attempt to finish what we started at the Fire Temple.   Being as how it will take us about eight to ten days to get back there, it will give us plenty of time to come up with a plan to get through.  So unless something interesting happens between now and when we get there, I will forego writing.<br></font>

<font size="3"><p align="left">

</font><p align="center">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">Earthday, the Eighth Day of Harvester, 591 cy</font><font size="6"> 
<p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well we arrived in Rastor and decided to head on to the Temples.  I had thought that we were going rest in Rastor and had pretty much decided to make it past the Air Temple gone Fire to the place where the guys had seen a big ugly called the Grand.  Nope, wasn�t meant to be.  Neither did we stop to rest in Rastor, nor did it turn out that we were to make it past the new Fire Temple area.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Upon gaining entrance into the smaller temple area, It was pretty much unanimously decided that we should go after the Rat-guy.  The fight we had with the Rat-guy went . . . Well , let me just say that it went less then desirable.  He just about kicked our collective butts.  Just before we beat him though, some cleric asshole got away to alert reinforcements. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Seeing as how it would take a good while for him to get those reinforcements we took the opportunity to prepare for them.  So that is where we are now.  Whether or not we are properly prepared remains to be seen.<br></font><p align="left">


<font face="Monotype Corsiva">


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, it turns out that we weren�t as prepared as we thought.  Due to several things that went wrong at once, we had to retreat back to Rastor.  One reason had to do with a faulty scroll of the spell called Haste.  I think that Quadro did something wrong when he wrote it, because  when it went off everything else seemed to speed up around me.  Anyway, we all made it back to Rastor in one piece and have decided to rest here now and go back tomorrow.  Maybe Quadro will do a better job in scribing his scrolls in the future.  I hope, anyway.<br></font><font size="6">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">Freeday, the Ninth Day of Harvester, 591 cy</font><font face="Monotype Corsiva"> <p align="left">

</font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today went better than I expected.  I still have trouble believing that Quadro had the nerve to actually just walk up to the door and just knock on it as if they would recognize us.  Yeah, that is where the fight started out.  After making it through that, we made to where the big wigs we were looking for.  I finally got to see that big ugly called the Grand, and yeah, was he ugly!  Sort of like a large intelligent ogre with demonic wings.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I think that Julin has found a new love in his life though, her name is Magly.  I think that he could love her to death in the literal sense.  The bitch, I think for some reason I cannot fathom, had it in for Julin as well.  Numenarh got to see Yadrick again.  We thought that we had killed the Grand, although he was saved through the use of a scroll of Resurrection.  The Grand, Magly, and Yadrick all three escaped.  I can only imagine what Nume is going through.  Seeing the one that killed his wife and then seeing that person get away.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I swear this. We will find them and we will kill them.  All three of them.  But, until then we will rest and hope for a better tomorrow.  I think that we are going to do well together.  But only if we are together.<br></font><font face="Monotype Corsiva"> <p align="left">

</font><p align="center">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">Starday, the Tenth Day of Harvester, 591 cy</font><p align="left"><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Upon our waking today, we had a long and drawn out discussion about what to do next.  Nume voiced wanting to go after Yadrick several times.  Can�t say that I blame him at all, though.  After a while, it was decided that we were to continue and fight on.  And it wasn�t long before we found a fight either; one that almost killed Rask.  Rask and Julin called them specters.  Three of them.  I cannot believe how they all went after Rask like they did.  Must have caught wind of what he can do to the undead.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Anyway, those specters evidently drain a person�s life-force every time they hit you.  Oh yeah, and they hate clerics to no end.  It shows in their relentlessness in attacking Rask.  Only when you hurt them do they turn their attentions to you.  Seeing as how they about killed Rask with only two or three hits, I know I didn�t want to be hit.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well despite it all we defeated the specters and decided that it would be a good idea to send Tyro again to Vurbobonc to get some scrolls that would help Rask get better.  So that is it for this day, Mewn.  We know from last time that we sent Tyro to Vurbobonc that it will take about four days for him to return.  Nothing should happen between now and then so until then, Stacia.<br>

Waterday, the Fourteenth Day of Harvester, 591 cy</font><p align="left"><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I cannot express enough how much I hate being in these tunnels.  I don�t see how these temple guys do it living down here.  Know wander they�re so messed up in the head.  At least Rask is better now, thanks to Tyro.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today we found the �Master of the Pit�. Turns out he was just a big blowhard of a gargoyle.  Rask and Julin were both knocked into the fighting pit.  I think that it gave us a sort of advantage. At least with Julin down there.  Numenarh would have been a better choice to be down there then Rask.  I mean, if there was a choice in the matter.  After we beat the snot out of the gargoyles, we decided to rest again.  Seeing as how our spell slingers used up most of their repertoire of spells. <br></font><p align="left"><p align="center">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">Earthday, the Fifteenth day of Harvester, 591 cy</font><p align="left"><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today was rather hectic, to say the least.  We found our way through some stuff called Yellow Mold to what we thought would be a simple fight.  Right, no such luck.  What turned out to be a skirmish with a few fish-men turned out to be a knock-down drag-out kill-or-die fight that we almost lost.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>There were two priest fish guys that were casting lightning bolts at us.  Only thing was that they had to work together on casting it.  So I attempted to take one of them out.  Two huge lobster things attacked us from the other side and was trouncing for a good bit of the fight.  The little fish guys weren�t much of a problem compared to the fishy priests and their pet lobsters.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Every time I got one of the priest down, the other would heal him and it would start all over again.  Then I got that damned spell Hold Person cast on me again.  I just knew that I was a goner again.  Then Meepo over and got between me and one of the fish priest and I knew I was gone.  All he had to do was cast another one of those lightning bolts and both Meepo and I would be goners.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>The lobster thingy that was still alive was wrecking havoc in that it had a hold of Quadro, Tyro, and Rask.  It was attempting to get Numenarh when I heard Julin�s familiar Sonic Stab, as he calls it.  I gather that it did something, though I could not tell what for the way I was facing.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I couldn�t tell by whom I was saved, but until I find out, I will be forever in these guys debt.  I heard Numenarh say something about Julin saving us all.  I swear I do not know what came over me, but I actually kissed Julin.  Thank the gods I missed his mouth.  EWWW!<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Needless to say, we are resting now.  I find myself looking at Julin and not seeing him as so much of a bad guy as he used to seem.  If he was just not so much of an ass at times.  What am I saying? EWW!  I�m going to trance now.=^_^=<br></font><p align="left"><p align="center">


<a name="entry13"><font face="Monotype Corsiva">Waterday, the Second Day of Ready�reat, 591 cy</font></a><p align="left"><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today was rather interesting.  Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that it possible that there were so many different and interesting kinds of people in this world.  First, let me remind you of the first thing that happened today.  After resting from the fight yesterday, we continued on and found ourselves confronting two more Destercans.   We thoroughly thrashed them. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>If wasn�t long after that that two very interesting people showed up walking up the pathway that we had just come.  It�s hard to really explain them.  They called themselves githzaeri and their names were Vit and Nox.  Nox was the sever quiet one of the two.  As it turned out, Vit is Nox�s mentor teaching Nox the way of being a monk.  Never met a monk before.  Vit said that he was also something called a Whirling Dervish.  Whatever that is.  Vit seems alright, I guess.  He just looks weird.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Nox on the other hand, sever unnerves me.  He wanders of without telling anyone where he is going.  Almost as if he appointed himself scout.  I got news for him, I�m the scout of this group and he had better not forget it.  So there. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>A little farther along the passageway, we came upon a crossway.  Nox again just took off down one passage without even so much as a gesture.  I can tell that he and I will be getting along.  I think that I will have to talk to Numenarh and Quadro about him.  I can tell that it seems to concern Nume a good bit, too.  Reason I can tell is that Nume actually furrowed his brow as Nox went down the passage.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well anyway we find out that there was something or someone down the passageway.  It was some insane paranoid druid guy that ate a little to many of the mushrooms that were littered all over �his� cave.   He seems relatively harmless, although he does make my right eye twitch.  Somehow, I cannot rightly remember how, we had discovered that this poor insane little man had some potions for sell and we bought them.  I wound up with three potions that grants darkvision that the mad druid told me lasted twelve hours.  We shall see.  <br>
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Well, I see that the huge bear that lives with the mad druid is eyeing me, I guess, with suspicion so I will put this journal away for tonight.  Goodnight, Stacia.  Trance well. <br>


Earthday, the Third Day of Ready�reat. 591 cy</font><p align="left"><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Rask died! Damned salamanders killed him!  Gods, everyone of this elemental temple will pay for killing Rask.  To better explain what happened I will have to start from the beginning of the day.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today started rather harmlessly enough.  I used one of the potions of Darkvision and scouted with Nox close behind me.  He still makes me nervous.  I mean Numenarh may be ole� stone face, but at least you know where you stand with him.  Nox is just plain creepy.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Anyway, we came upon a nest of giant red ants.  If it had not been for Drak, I hate to admit, I think that the encounter could have easily gone bad.  Drak was somehow able to convey to them that we were not hostile toward them.  We were able to make our way through them without one altercation.  Pretty impressive I must say.<br>

After we made it past the ants, we came upon a large room that had a huge red diamond pattern in the center with four black monoliths a few feet away from it its sides and a large glass sphere that appeared to have rolling flames inside of it.  We all thought it a trap.  Just as I thought it though, Julin threw his blanket over the sphere.  That seemed to disable it, that is if it even needed to be disabled.  Thinking back now, I think that Julin is part cat.  If so, then curiosity has taken at least five of his lives, and that is just since I have met him.  There is no telling how many he has lost before hand.  He cannot have to many left.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Anyway reason for me thinking on that is that Julin had let curiosity get the best of him again and he had to see what the sphere did.  He climbed under the blanket whatever he did under there made a fire elemental appear and attacked him.  We quickly dispatched it, though.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>A little further on we encountered a group of guards in which only one got away. It was enough.  We chased him into a yellowish sulfur smelling mist.  Little did we realize that he had let us into a trap.  There were fire nephits inside the mist that would shoot flames at us.  I barely was able to dodge some of them.  Quadro and I were able to take a few of them out, but there was just to many of them.  The others had gotten out earlier so it was just me after Quadro got out as well.  After I made it out of the mist, I was surprised to see that Numenarh had actually fallen into a pit.  From what everyone told me, Nox had used some kind of magic that even Julin had not seen before to make him fall a slow as a feather.  After I made it across, I threw my slippers to Numenarh so that he could climb out.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>It was just a little further down the passageway that we found the fight the killed Rask.  We had just entered a large cavern with Nox and me scouting ahead.  We found that there were three exits from the room we had just entered.  Upon checking out the first one, we found three Salamanders.  I do not mean the small wet kinds you find in mud puddles either.  These were flaming serpentine creatures as big as, if not larger than, us. They were muscular and had red and blackish scales, with hawkish faces.  Just by looking at them one could tell that they were cruel and enjoyed tormenting others. In fighting these things, we also found out that they were severely bloodthirsty and sadistic.  One of them were larger then the other two, though.  Obviously he was the one in charge.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As our fight with them continued, I could tell that Rask was getting hurt pretty badly.  We all were.  I had taken a few bad hits and was being flanked by the smaller two of the three.  The evident leader was hanging back, planning something that I was sure would not be good for us.  Just then, the larger salamander came after Rask and struck him down.  I didn�t even hear Rask cry out because it killed him so quickly.  I don�t think that Rask even saw it coming.  Needless to say, Numenarh and everyone got really mad.  I know that I did.  I hope that Rask will come back.  I miss him already.  Even though he got on my nerves some, he did not deserve to die.  Rask was and still is a good person.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After destroying the salamanders, I found that Drak had gone searching around right after we were attacked by the salamanders.  Why would he do that?  After the fight he told us that he was attack by two hellhounds while Nox and Julin had taken out a wizard woman that had attacked us from behind.  I think that we are getting fairly close to a fight that we will not be able to win.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>With the salamanders, wizard and hellhounds dead, we were finally able to relax a slight bit.  I do not know what caused it, or why it happened, but a severe argument started between Numenarh and Julin about how to go about getting Rask back.  Seeing that this argument wasn�t going to end anytime soon, I decided to take this opportunity to write to you, Stacia.  And that is where I am right now.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I see that Nox has somewhat the same idea that I do in the fact that he has just wandered off again.  Quadro seems to be enjoying the argument very much.  Meepo looks really confused on why his friends are fighting each other.  Drak�s just leaning against the wall.  He�s probably thinking �No wander Tyro died hanging around this group. They fight all of the time�.  I can only imagine what Vit is thinking right now. <br>
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Ok, I think that that has gone on long enough.  They are still fighting.<br></font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Numenarh�s words to me have wounded me deeply.  He treated me as someone he hated.  What is happening to us?  Don�t they understand that due to them yelling as they have, that they have probably alerted the enemies of our weaknesses, our exact location, and our numbers?  What�s worse is that they are yelling as each other because of money.  Numenarh wants to use the money that Tyro had to bring Rask back, only Julin sees it as Numenarh stealing from him and that we should use Rask�s own money to bring Rask back.   <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I�ve had enough of this.  I think that I will go and see if Tyro�s money is even there to use.<br></font><p align="left">


<font face="Monotype Corsiva">


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>No go on that idea.  I guess I will go and look around elsewhere.  Quadro has suggested that he cast his Improved Invisibility on me.<br></font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>It seems that today was not done with us after all.  As I left the area after Quadro casting that Invisibility spell on me I saw Now returning with a few barrels of some liquid.   As I scouted around that are, making sure that we were not going to be surprised or anything, I found a room that you will never forget.  Hopefully, Stacia, you will not have nightmares of the sight I am about to remind you of.  I had found a room that held such an utterly horrific sight to behold.  .  Decaying flesh from bodies hung on hooks and various devices used for horrendous torturing.  Most of the flesh had been torn away or removed.  Only some flesh remained on some of the bodies.  The bodies were mutilated from hours of torture.  I think that the most horrifying thing was that there was a bed in this room.  The monster that was responsible for all of this, actually slept here.  He lived with this carnage.  As if he loved it.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Upon seeing this sight, I lost whatever food that was left in my stomach while at the same time trying to scream.  After I was able to compose myself I noticed a chest that appeared to be a person bound into a fetal position and chained that way.  Overwhelmed with a mixture of grief, misery, and fury, I tried to destroy the lock with Zephyr�s blast then tried hacking at it. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As I was hacking at the chest is when everyone burst through the curtain hiding this room.  I saw that the room effected them in pretty much the same way.  Numenarh yelled out to me and when I looked at him I saw that he was wiping away tears.  I am surprised at how the room dissolved away at seeing that Numenarh had been crying.  My first thought was what had they others done to him?  As it turned out Numenarh, I think, had finally been hit by everything that he has gone through.  Mainly, Menyoh and her death.  I just hope that I can help him through the anguish he is feeling.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After everyone had found that I was alright, Quadro requested me to search the grisly room for anything that would help us find out who made this carnage.  We found a man inside of an iron maiden who had been tortured to the point of madness. In the chest, I found was a beautiful deep red ruby.  I decided to hold on to it for safe keeping until we could sell it.  Upon seeing that there was nothing to find in this room Julin decided to use his Recall Tale ability to see what he could find out. What he found out was that a gnome Tesimon had committed these atrocities.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>It was unanimously decided that it was a good idea for us to go back to the insane druid�s place to rest and for Vit to do something called planeshifting to get Rask brought back to life.  Only it was not meant to be for us to rest.  Right after Vit disappeared, we were attacked by  the Grand, Tesimon, and nine others.  They also had a pet with them. Something that Julin called a Grey Render.  This creature was about nine feet tall and about four feet wide.  Its skin is gray and on its sloped forehead are six small yellowish eyes.  Its huge mouth was filled with black teeth.  I could see that there were glyphs all over its body, one of them was aglow. From the way it moved I could tell that the glyph granted it the properties of the spell Haste.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>At first, we were getting trounced.  Both Julin and Meepo fell in the battle.  I felt that the only way we were going to survive this would be for me to use my Bead of Force.  In doing so, I capturing one of them and damaging the majority of their group, but I killed Meepo.  An acceptable risk, I think.  Numenarh used his as well, capturing two others.  I could tell that I was dealing a lot of damage to the Render, only it was severely tough to fight.  Only through the combined efforts of everyone did we finally win.  I think that we are now starting to work better as a team.  We might stand a chance to survive all of this. <br>
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After we looted the dead bodies and disposed of the ones in the bubbles of force created by the beads, we headed back to the insane druids place.  Oh yeah, we use a scroll of Raise Dead on Meepo, so it�s back.  I swear if that druid looks at me wrong,  I will kill him and that damned bear. =^_^=<br></font><p align="center"><p align="center">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I do not know what is happening to me.  I am starting to hear Death telling me that my time is near unless I get someone else to take my place by killing them.<br>  

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Nox and I were scouting ahead and found a room that had flames churning in the center of it.  On the other side was an alcove with a man chained up and unconscious.  The first thing I thought was that I could kill him to keep Death at bay.  I reached for my lockpicks and unlocked his manacles and then woke him.  He must have been through a lot, for he had prepared to attack me with a spell.  After calming him down I found out his name was Morticai, a sorcerer.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After noticing that we were getting overburdened with things that we had found, we decided to split up and one group take things to Vurbobonc and sell the stuff while the other group stays in Rastor to wait for Rask and Vit.  It was decided that it would be Quadro, Julin, Meepo and me to take and sell the booty.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>And that is where we are now heading to Vurbobonc. I will write more later. =^_^=<br></font><p align="left"><p align="center">

<a name="entry15"><font face="Monotype Corsiva">Starday, the Fifth Day of Ready�reat, 591 cy</font></a><p align="left"><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I have decided what I will go about killing Quadro, Meepo, and Julin.  Rather easy if I do say myself.  Julin will be the first to die.  Then it will be  little Meepo�s turn.  Then Quadro will be last, just in cast he somehow survives my initial attack, but not until he enhances my armor with shadow first.  Shouldn�t be much of a problem.  Hell, it�ll be fun.  Watching the blood flow out of their twitching bodies.  Kind of funning now that I think about it. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I like this new way of thinking.  Gives you a sense of freedom and power.  Death will be pleased with what I will be sending him.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Maybe I�ll display my handiwork in the trees around here as a tribute to Death.  He might like it.  Who knows, Death may take me as a bride.  <br>


Moonday, the Seventh Day of Ready�reat, 591 cy</font><p align="left"><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We met Rask  and Vit on the way to Vurbobonc today.  A blessing in disguise, I guess.  Have Rask here annoys me, because now I have to plan when the right time to kill him will be.  I think that I can convince Vit to teach me that Dervish shit. It could be useful in killing everyone.<br></font><p align="left"><p align="center">


<font face="Monotype Corsiva">Earthday, the Tenth Day of Ready�reat, 591 cy</font><p align="left"><p align="left">
  


<font face="Monotype Corsiva">
  


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We�re here at Vurbobonc now, and today was rather fun.  I found out that Ailyce was extorting money from me and Jeleket�s Roost.  So I killed her.  I think that even if I had let her live she would not have been able to find a job as a whore or even a wife for that matter, so I put her out of her misery.  Good thing Zhanna was watching so that she could learn from Ailyce�s mistake.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Satisfied that I had made my point clear, I decided to go look for Quadro to see how my armor was coming along.  Nothing yet.  While in the magic shop, two guards burst in to arrest me.  Whatever.  It was way to easy to convince Quadro to attack them.   I was almost amazed at how stupid he was. Not only did he help me, but he hurt several others in the process.  Needless to say I ran out and to Jeleket�s Roost to have a little chat with Zhanna and the story she told the constable and how she was going to recant that story if she valued her life.  Even if I were to be captured, I would get away and make sure that she died in a worse way than Ailyce. I think she got the point.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I then went to find Vit to convince him to teach me outside the city where we would not be disturbed.  Later, though, I heard someone approaching and took my leave.  I decide to head back to Jeleket�s Roost and hide in the hideaway room there.  Upon entering though, I saw Malachai talking to some of the women.  That told me that Numenarh and the others had to be around.   <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I made my way up the stairs and realized that Numenarh was more than likely tracking me.  That meant that I needed to be more clever, so I used the walls and ceiling to get to the hideaway.  That is where I am now. I know that they will find me, only when they do, they will get the surprise of their lives.  I will not be taken alive.  Hopefully Numenarh will be the one to kill me.  The last bit of pain I will be able to cause.  Here they come.<br></font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Forgive me. Please forgive me.  Ailyce, Numenarh, Quadro, Meepo, everyone. I do not know how any of you could ever forgive me of what I have done to all of you.  I paid to have Ailyce to be raised and allowed her to still work for me, though not in a leadership position. I have left Zhanna and Jenna to look after Jeleket�s Roost.</font> <p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Numenarh. Nume. I attacked you.  I hurt you.  All of the things that you have gone through and then I do this to you.  Quadro, Rask, Meepo, Julin.  I was going to kill all of you.  Even if you all can forgive me; I cannot forgive myself.  Maybe in give credit where credit is due in my capture will be a small way for me to absolve some of my guilt, though I doubt it. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>When I forced them to attack me in the hideaway in Jeleket�s Roost, Quadro had used his magic to turn me into a duck.  I would have gotten away if it were not for Nox�s monk training to stun me.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>In the jail cell they were able to figure out that if they shattered the stone (despite my attempts to convince them that if they did so I would die)  I would be freed of the curse the stone had put me under.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>In shattering it, so started the justice that I deserve.  Overwhelming guilt has washed over me that has permeated my soul.   Zhanna fears me, and I hate myself for causing it.  The group is acting like nothing ever happened.  Numenarh has given me the ring that was Menyoh to wear around me neck.  Quadro has made me, in addition to enhancing my armor with Shadow, a pair of goggle that allow me to see in the dark.  Why is everyone being so nice to me? I do not deserve this. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Soon we are to leave for Rastor and the Temple of Elemental Evil.  I only hope that I can pay everyone back for the kindness they have shown me. =^_^=<br></font><p align="left"><p align="center">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">



<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today We left to return to the Temple.  No one is talking about what happened at all.  Almost seems like it is a subject that everyone is purposefully avoiding.  I cannot thank them enough.  I have had a lot of time to think about some things today.  I need to find out about my parents and just find Mazeric.  If Julin could find it in his heart to use his ability to do what he calls Recalling of a Tale, I think that it would be a great help to me.  Only problem is I am not sure if he would do his Recall Tale the way I wish for him to; as in not around others. I think that I will ask him tomorrow.<br></font><p align="left"><p align="center">

Sunday, the Thirteenth Day of Ready�reat, 591 cy</font><p align="left"><p align="left">



<font face="Monotype Corsiva">



<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I am writing now through tears of bitter sorrow.  I have found that my mother has murdered my father.  I attempted to write down word for word what Julin said as for he goes into a trance-like state when he recalls a tale. Here is what the tale held for me to know: <br></font><p align="left">


<font face="Monotype Corsiva">


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>&quot;Mandrick pushed through the thick forest undergrowth and stopped to catch his breath.  He'd been running for almost an hour.  "Damn."  Sehainine Moonbow, by her grace, had healed most of his physical wounds, but after what he'd seen, he doubted his mental ones would ever heal. He closed his eyes for a moment, lost in thought.  -Tong-  The arrow flew out of nowhere and Mandrick barely moved in time; that shot could have killed him.  His assailant was an excellent shot, and the fact that the bolts had some of the most deadly poison on them he'd ever seen didn't help either.  And then he was up and running again, but he knew he couldn't shake his attacker.  She was too good, and Mandrick was out of spells that could aid him in his escape.  He was beginning to resign himself to the fact that he would soon be in Sehainine's embrace.  -Tong-  The next arrow slashed his arm, not a deep shot, but he felt the poison immediately, and he staggered as he felt his muscles beginni!
ng to shut down.  He began to loose his balance, and tripped on a hidden tree root, just as the next arrow sung out.  -Tong-  Mandrick tried to push himself up, but fell back down.  He just couldn't do it, the poison was working too fast.  From where he lay he saw the last arrow was imbedded in a tree, about where his neck was right before he fell.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>"He lay there for what seemed like an eternity as he thought back on the events that had let up to this, and silently wept, not for himself but for his family.  He heard his assailant making her way through the brush carefully.  Perhaps she was worried that he hadn't been hit.  Perhaps she was trying to avoid a trap that wasn't there.<br>
 
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>"It seemed to Mandrick to take an eternity before his attacker emerged from the forest brush.  Mandrick looked at her with tears in his eyes.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>"'Tilan,' he said.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>"The only answer was the bow.  -Tong-"<br></font><p align="left">


<font face="Monotype Corsiva">


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I could not write fast enough  to write here all of what he said so I will remind you as best I can why you need to find and bring your mother to justice; alive or dead.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Mother, where ever you are, I will find you and make you pay for what you have done and what you have caused.  To cold heartedly murder the man you proclaimed to love enough to marry and have a child with him.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>The sorry I feel in my heart is almost overwhelming to me.  But I must hide it. I must bury it deep within me until I have the time and resources to deal with Tilan.  Tilan your daughter will find you and bring justice with her.  Only for until the Temple of Elemental Evil falls are you safe from me.  I will get you.<br></font><p align="left"><p align="center">


<font face="Monotype Corsiva">Waterday, the Sixteenth Day of Ready�reat, 591 cy</font><p align="left"><p align="left">



<font face="Monotype Corsiva">



<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We have reached Rastor again and have decided that resting for the night was the best course of action.  I do not know if anyone has noticed my renewed determination to end the Temple yet.  I can see that Numenarh is concerned for me.  He worries so much about me, it�s almost sweet.  I do not know if he realizes just how much it meant to me that he and Nox stayed with me in that cell trying to comfort me.  Though, I think that Nox was there more to see if I would attack Nume.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Anyway, tomorrow we attack the Temple anew.  Good luck to us all.  We�ll be needing it.<br></font><p align="left"><p align="center">


<font face="Monotype Corsiva">Earthday, the Seventeenth Day of Ready�reat, 591 cy</font><p align="left"><p align="left">


<font face="Monotype Corsiva">


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>There are several things that I thought that I would never see.  First was the amount of undead that we faced and the second was Julin as a Minotaur.  That will stick with you.  A Minotaur in all bright clothes.  Yeah, I know, Stacia, You didn�t need to be reminded about the visual. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today started kind of strange.  When we reached the entrance of the fire temple, we noticed that it seemed to have been abandoned.  With me and Nox scouting ahead, we found that it had indeed been abandoned.  It wasn�t until much later that we were to find out that they had retreated to refortify themselves.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Nox and I, scouting ahead, found a room that was guarded by four gnolls and two ogres.  When we returned to the rest of the group to tell them of what we found, we all decided that a full frontal attack was the best action.  It wasn�t.  It turned out that we had been heard either discussing our strategy or walking up.  Either way, when we rushed into the room they had the time to refortify their position by adding six trolls.  Thinking that I would be safe in doing so, I entered along the ceiling using my slippers.  Little good they did me.  I was struck fast and hard enough to knock me right out.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I woke up the sounds of the continuing fight in full swing.  Immediately, I rushed back into the fray.  It took us a bit but we won the fight.  Despite the trolls and their ability to come back from damage that would normally have killed anything else their size.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After finishing off the trolls, we headed back to the room with the brazier and headed down a different path way.  After a ways, we found three sarcophagi.  Upon searching them, I found that all three were magically trapped.  Quadro took it upon himself to dispel the magic.  He said that it was something called Firetrap.  Sounds nasty.  I then found the way to open the sarcophagi.  Two of the three had magical stuff in them, but it just didn�t seem right to take them.  So with very little coaxing from Nox, we left them.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We continued on until we found more coffins laying around.  I think that there were about four or five.  I cannot really recall due to the wracking pain that washed over me after I reached into one of them.  When everyone saw what happened to me, they told Rask to remove what ever it was that was happening to me.  Only Rask acted like he didn�t want to.  More to the point, like it was a real bother for him to do that for me.  If he acted this way with his little sister, then I do not want him thinking of me in that way.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Through some coercion and some pushing he finally consented to try a spell called Remove Disease  and then Remove Curse.  I am not sure which he did first or which one did the trick, but I know that I started to feel better after it.  Drak kept me alive while the whole coercion thing was going on to get Rask to help me.  I think that I am starting to trust Drak a lot now.  Rask has been acting a little strange to me.  Almost like he holds me in contempt.  Not that I blame him, though.  After what I did and all.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After Rask fixed me, we continued on and found a whole tomb full of coffins.  At least fifteen or twenty of them.  We didn�t think anything about them, other than that we were NOT going to open them at all.  At least I knew that I wasn�t.  When we reached about halfway through the room we were ambushed by shadows and specters.  Just started floating through out of the coffins and the walls.  Immediately they went after Rask.  Either those things do not like Rask personally or they just do not like priests in general.  I hope for the latter. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We almost did not make it.  Every time we were hit by one of these things something would happen to us.  The shadows would make us fell weaker and the specters made us feel as if our very life essence were being sapped from us.  If was Rask who did the most to make use be able to win this fight.  He through his holy symbol of St. Cuthbert made most of them run away.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After we were safe again, we found out that Julin could hard carry anything.  That�s when Quadro had  good idea for once.  He turned Julin into a Minotaur and then enlarged him.  Now let me say one thing here, seeing a gigantic Minotaur dressed in bright colors will stay with you.  NOT a pretty site.  Not only that, but I didn�t think that Julin would fit through the passageways to get back to the room with the brazier for us to rest.  He did though.  And that is where I am now.  I think that we are doing fairly well for ourselves now that we are working more like a team.  <br>


Freeday, the Eighteenth day of Ready�reat, 591cy</font><p align="left"><p align="left">


<font face="Monotype Corsiva">


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Julin�s dead.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today started with Rask again feeling put out about having to use his magic to help the group.  More to the point, me, it is starting to seem like he is against using his magic to help me.  I am almost to the point that I am going to tell him that if he thinks that way, then I would rather he not use his magic on me at all.  I mean, if he doesn�t wish to, I do not want him thinking that he is forced to help me.  I will have to find the right time to talk to him.  He seems a bit touchy as well.  Almost like he did when he blew up at Numenarh and Julin way back when.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After everyone was back to normal, he continued back through the tomb area and found a passageway that had a barred exit way.  Upon look through it, we saw that it was actually an exit to one of the bridges that lead to the center portion of the crater.  It was discussed among everyone on whether or not it was a good idea to attack the center.  I severely disliked the idea.  Right, it was decided that Nox was to run all by himself to the end and check things out.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>When Nox returned, however, it was then agreed upon that it wasn�t a good idea to attack the center.  It sort of spooked me that the lightning towers didn�t even fire at Nox.  I think that it worried Quadro, as well, for he decided that it was better for us to continue on in the tunnels.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After a while we entered a room that had four different looking statues in it. At closer inspection, we found that each of the statues were in fact statues of four different elementals. Fire, earth, air, and water.  Needless to say, we were a little on the leery side of even messing with them.  I for one didn�t want to chance the fact that I would activate them, just in case they were real elementals waiting to be released by a tripping of the trap.  Nox wanted to shatter them.  Though it most likely was a good idea, I thought that it might activate it.  So he didn�t.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>That room led into another one that had a huge circle with large sigils within it.   Upon examining the magical aura, Quadro determined that it was conjuration magic.  Ok, I do not know a lot about magic but I do know that if you conjure something, it was normally something bad.  Of course, Quadro just HAD to step into that ring to see what happened.  It wasn�t good.  Not good at all.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>First of all, the amount of ugly that came up from the floor was almost indescribable.  Two big bad and uglies were conjured from Quadro stepping into that circle.  Numenarh called them beetleliths.  I thought they looked more like a crab than a beetle, myself.  Anyway, these things were over fifteen feet wide and had an incredible reach.  The two worst things about these huge creatures were the fact that I could hear them inside my mind telling me to die and that they destroy armor like it was nothing.  They looked like a cross between a spider, a crab, and an insect.  All around, just plain ugly and mean.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>If the fight with these things from a nightmare gone worse, we found out that only magical damage does anything to them.  Numenarh�s arrows hardly did a thing.  Even when the arrows did pierce their armored hide, it appeared that they immediately healed from it.  All I could do to them was make them mad.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>In the fight, one of them attacked me out right and down right shredded my armor to tatters with its talon-like claws.  Then it bit me.  Right away I new that it had injected me with venom for I could feel it like fire running through my veins.  Almost immediately, I fell unconscious.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I awoke later from Drak casting a spell to heal me.  It seems like he is healing me more than Rask.  Drak�s nicer about it, too.  After I had gotten up, I could see that everyone had been able to fell one of them.  Just then the other one struck out and Julin fell motionless.  Julin�s body then reverted back to normal.  I ran over to where Numenarh was kneeling over Julin�s body.  Nume just looked at me and said that Julin was dead. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Stunned speechless, I did nothing but stand there.  That left only Numenarh as the only one of us that has not died.  I could tell that this truly bothered Numenarh.   I�ll have to do everything that I can to make sure that nothing happens to him.  I don�t know what I would do if� Numenarh cannot die.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Rask told us that he could take us to a place called the Seven Heavens.  At first I thought that he was joking so I laughed.  His deadpan look told me that he wasn�t.  That was when I flatly said that I wasn�t going.  Everyone keeps trying to tell me that it will all be all right, but I know that you only go to Heaven if you die.  And that is only if you have been good your entire life.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After everyone sort of gave up trying to convince me to go to Heaven, we decided to rest.  Good. Maybe everyone will forget about wanting to do this Planeshift thing and go to Dyvers to bring Julin back.   I will remind you if they made me go or not tomorrow.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We were attacked!  They actually tried to go on the offensive against us. Eight humans and four trolls. Two of the humans, apparently the leaders of their entourage.  Quadro was on the ball with casting Haste and Improved Invisibility on me.  Numenarh was right on the mark with his arrows.  In short they didn�t stand a chance.  Only one of the human monks got away.  Looks like from the medallions they were wearing that we have reached the Earth Temple.  I think that we are safe now, though.  Until tomorrow, then, Stacia. =^_^=<br></font><p align="left"><p align="center">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>All that has happened to me today cannot be explained with true justice.  Everything that I have seen and witnessed, I could not have ever dreamed possible.  Though it did start out a bit rough and unhappily.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After everyone got up this morning, we started discussing, again, what to do about getting Julin back.  Rask, again, brought up that he could take us to the heavens.  Again, I vehemently refused to go.  That was when Numenarh told me that I was going.  TOLD me, as in an order.  He told me that I was not going to be left behind.  That didn�t make me feel any better about going, but it did make me feel better in the general sense.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Rask told everyone to join hands and we all did so.  Julin draped over Numenarh�s shoulder.  I closed my eyes tight as Rask started to recite his spell.  Suddenly, I felt myself falling and the first thought to hit me was that I was falling into the Nine Hells.  Then I landed in water. thought it was of a mild temperature, it was still wet.  Luckily I was able to keep myself from freaking out and screaming under the water and swam up to the surface.  Upon reaching the surface, I was able to see that it was nighttime.  Right, with it being night, there was now chance of a fisherman finding us.<br>
 
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I saw Rask standing on the water and walking around, Meepo swimming around and rather liking the swim, and Drak was swimming rather well.  I could not see Numenarh, Julin, or Quadro at all.  Just as I was getting fearful for Nume and Quadro, I saw them break the surface and with company.  I hate to admit that I squealed as I was grabbed from behind by a smiling man with greenish skin.  I was able to see below the surface that each of these guys had a torso of a man and the lower half of an octopus!<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>The one that had me asked me if I needed his help.  I could only nod at him dumbly.  Evidently, everyone was asked the same thing and had replied yes.  As they helped us, I was astounded by the beauty of the stars in the sky.  As much as I admired those stars, though, nothing prepared me for the sight I was about to witness.  The octomen brought us to the shores of the largest mountain I have ever seen.  They called it Mount Celestia. <br>
 
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Upon reaching the shore I asked one of the octomen if people normally fell into the water when they came here.  He confirmed my suspensions that Rask never knows what he is doing.  The octoman told me that everyone that enters the Heavens fall into the sea.  Rask didn�t even know that.  He could have killed all of us!  The thing that really got to me was the fast that Rask said that he was here when he was brought back to life and he didn�t even bother to ask about the place.  In the short time that we were here we found out that this whole plane is :one, the first plane of the seven heavens; two, called Mount Celestia; three, that Mount Celestia is the ONLY land on this plane; four, that everyone that enters this plane falls into the Silver Sea; and let us not forget the fifth thing that we found out. Even though this is the plane of law and good, evil people can live here as well.  Now, if Rask had known all of this and did not tell us, that means only one of two th!
ings.  Either he is incredibly incompetent or he is hiding things for us for a reason. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After yelling at Rask I turned around and was struck dumb by the beauty of the Mount Celestia.  Everything was so green and lush.  Just by looking at it feeled you with peace.  One could very easily believe that no evil could even exist here.  Numenarh looked at me and suggested that I could repent here for the things that I did in the last few weeks.  I think that he saw how that made me feel for he trying to cheer me up some.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As Numenarh, Quadro and I asked about the area around here, and Nox was able to answer almost every question we had.  Rask didn�t have a single clue and appeared to be effected by the beauty of this place more so than anyone else.  Nox actually became our spokes person for us.  Funny, Nox seems to feel more at home here than he did on Oerth.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>At Quadro�s prompting, Nox asked the octomen if there were boats that could be hired or used.  The octomen said that there were and that they would bring us one.  After our boat arrived, I saw that there wouldn�t be room for me to train.  I must get better at using my sword so that I will be able to better defend my friends.  Maybe I will be able to keep Nume alive.<<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>The octomen pushed us in the boat along the shore until we were able to reach the docks.  Upon landing in a place called Heart�s Faith, We were greeted by a big glowing ball named Ross. It startled me so bad that I drew my sword in defense.   Hell, I didn�t know if it was going to attack me or not.  Anyway, it backed away which told me that it wasn�t a threat.  After putting Zephyr away, Ross informed me about the threats of attacking people unprovoked.  Good advise to have.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Upon talking with Ross while he led us to a huge beautiful city,  we found that we needed to talk to someone named Lebis at the Temple of Bahamut.  Bahamut is the god of all metallic dragons according to Numenarh.  When asked how we would recognize Lebis, Ross told us that he was a llamasu.  I guess he noticed the look on our faces for he described what a llamasu looked like.  Imagine a lion�s body and mane with a human�s face and eagle�s wings!<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>When we reached the Temple of Bahamut, the site was awesome to behold.  There where depictions of Bahamut soaring through the air, take to flight, and landing on the peak of a mountain.  Everything was made with such care and artisanship that it was difficult not to weep at the mere sight of it.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Everyone was just as speechless as I was it seemed for we didn�t notice a centaur looking creature approach us.  I say centaur looking in the meaning that instead of have the torso of a horse, he was goat.  We asking him about Lebis and he told us that Lebis was busy at that moment and that he would retrieve Ra�hoo for us.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We didn�t wait for long before a very large person approached us with golden scales and wings.  As he got closer we could see that he was half dragon.  I was in total shock of everything that we have seen. Ra�hoo told us that we could leave Julin�s body and that he would be brought back in following morning.  The fact that this place was in perpetual night, albeit a beautiful night, was a little confusing to us in the way of being able to tell when it was morning.  He told us how long from then to come back.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After leaving Julin�s body with Ra�hoo, we left Bahamut�s Temple.  While everyone was discussing what to do next, I walked up to an elf and asked him about Sehainine Moonbow.  What I got was so much information that I could not begin to write here everything he told me.  Mainly because I cannot remember most of it.  What I do remember is that Sehainine Moonbow resides on a plane called Arboria.  When I asked him about Shadow Dancers, he asked if they existed in the plane of shadow.  I told him no even though I don�t really know.  I don�t even know what a plane of shadow is like.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After a bit, I think, everyone sorted to feel as overwhelmed as I did and was starting to get rather tired. I know that I was.  We all went to a nice looking place and paid for a room for some rest.  Tomorrow we get to great Julin back.  I sort of cannot wait to see his face when he sees everything that we have seen.  He might even be speechless for the first time in his life.  Until tomorrow then, Stacia.  Trance well.<br></font><p align="left"><p align="center">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">
Sunday, the Twentieth Day of Ready�reat, 591 cy</font><p align="left"><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Today was amazing!  So much stuff to write about I don�t know where to start.   Well no sense in deviating from the norm I guess.  So I will start from the beginning.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As soon as everyone got up, we all headed to Bahamut�s Temple to great Julin back to the land of the living. Or rather, well, you know what I meant.  I was a little fearful that Julin would return, but I thought that him not wanting anyone to have his money would win over. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As Ra�hoo the half-dragon cast the spell to call Julin back,  the diamond that Ra�hoo held in his hand fell to dust onto Julin�s body.  The dust glowed and looked like it was absorbed into Julin�s body.  Julin�s eyes then opened slowly and looked up to see the half-dragon�s from.  The look on Julin�s face was priceless!  We explained everything to him before he freaked out though.  I think that it would have been funny to see Julin loss his nerve for once.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After we were through calming Julin and telling him where he was, he was really enthusiastic about looking around and seeing what was to be seen.  It strange how everyone that has died and were brought back do not see it as a big deal� all except for me.  Am I all that different?  Maybe death bothers me more only because I am an elf.  Maybe there is some racial reason that I think of death as something to really worry about.  Quadro, Rask, and now Julin.  All of them seem to just see it as something that happened to them.  That it doesn�t bother them at all.  Maybe I am not meant to understand.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We all decided to go with Numenarh to talk to someone named Kyrneth.  Nume said that he talked to him the other night and that he was at the Library.  Numenarh felled to mention that Kyrneth was a talking BEAR!  Kyrneth even had eye spectacles.  Through talking to him we found that we can get back to Oerth closer to where ever we want.  Only thing is that we would have to a place called Sigil.  Kyrneth told us that it was impossible to get there any other way than a portal.  Upon asking where one was, he told us.  I asked Numenarh and Quadro if we could go to Arboria to attempt to find my father�s spirit.  That was when it was explained by Kyrneth that he would not have any of his memories and it would be virtually impossible to find him.  Quadro told me that it would probably be a good idea to have him Truly Resurrected.  I�ll do that, dad.  I promise.  I�ll se you again. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Upon reaching Sigil, I immediately recognized the sort of place it was.  I warned everyone to watch their money and their possessions.  Sigil is a very unusual place, let me tell you.  As your eyes follow the street, you can see, in the distance, that it starts to incline upward.  Now I do not mean just a little incline either, and not just one way. Both ways inclined as if we were inside of a large wheel.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After looking for someone to ask questions of we were greeted by a talking box.  It called itself Brain Box; a modron although it had separated itself from the modron collective.  Yeah, whatever that is.  The modron thing had two legs and two arms, but it had something sticking out of the side of, where I would think of as, its head and reached around to be in front of its right eye.  Really weird.  He told us where we should go to get any information we needed and wished us luck.  When asked, it hadn�t heard of Shadow Dancers either.  He did tell me about a place called the Gymnasium and that it would be a good place for me to look into.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We went along the main thoroughfare through the market area.  I could tell that it was getting more and more seedy the more we entered this particular area.  While there, a guy approached me and offered to sell me a sword that looked to be made of a greenish metal.  The peddler told us that it was made of something called balor metal or some such.  He also told us that it held magical properties.  He also said something about that it was made from pure hate.  I remembered something that I heard from some of the wizened adventures that magical things used for good were most often made from evil things.  He said that he was selling it for seven hundred gold.  Sensing that he was telling me the truth, I traded him my Slippers of Spider Climbing for it.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After putting it into my backpack, we continued on until we entered the clerk area.  On the way to the appropriate building, we passed some headquarters form a people called the Sensates.  A half-elf was coming out of the Sensate building that was wearing very little clothing and barely that.  Numenarh�s eyes just about popped out of their sockets.  He couldn�t stop looking at her.  Does he like that type of woman?  She was very beautiful.  Looked like she was luck to get the best of both races in her looks. <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>As we continued on, I could tell that Nume was looking at all the women that were wearing clothes like the Sensates.  Maybe if I dressed like that, he would notice me.  Maybe someone would notice me.  All of the women here are so beautiful, though.  Would I even be noticed next to them? Who knows.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After getting to the right building, everyone went in to see if the guy that we needed to see was there.  I asked Nox to go with me somewhere while they were talking to Kyrneth.  Pretty cool that Nox didn�t even ask why or where we would be going, he just said yes and came with me.  After we were out of earshot of the rest of the group I told Nox that I wanted his opinion on some clothes.  I think that I embarrassed him a little, I can�t tell.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I chose three different outfits.  One is a really scantly type of outfit.  It feels good but I feel sort of naked in it.  The second outfit is a really pretty gown for when and if we need to dress up.  Not use to dresses.  Nox smiled when he saw it so I guess it looks nice.  The third outfit is one that Nox chose for me.  It looks rather nice in its simplicity.  Feels really good on.  I think that it will be the outfit that I wear the most.  Nox also bought me a pair of boots that are extremely comfortable.  All of this Nox bought me.  When I looked at him he reminded me that he owed me money anyway, so I guess that is all right.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After he bought my clothes, Nox and I headed back to the rest of the group. I�ll have to get use to it.  While I wear it I feel like I am being stared at.  Kind of a nice feeling.  I think I like it.  I just hope that they are not looking at me because they think that I am ugly.  We reached that building that everyone was talking with Kyrneth and Everyone looked at me like they were scared or something.  Nume all but said that with the way I looked I could start a brothel here in Sigil.  So in effect I look like a whore to him.  Great.  He tried to tell me that it was meant to be a compliment, but it still hurt.   Quadro�s eyes bugged out more than usual, though I think that I startled him more than anything.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I decided that I didn�t want to be around them for a while so I told them that I was going to look for a temple of elven pantheons and the gymnasium that I had heard about.  Numenarh declared that he was going to go with me.  On our way out the guy we came to talk told us about something called a sedan chair would be safer and more relaxing for us to use to get there.  He described what it looked like and we thanked him.  On the way outside I thought that Numenarh was going to apologize for his comment about me looking whorish, he didn�t though.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>We found the sedan chair shortly after leaving the building.  It looking rather unusual.  They ride was rather smooth.  We made it to the temple but I didn�t find out much more than I have already heard.  I told Nume that I was going to go the Gymnasium to check it out and see what it was like.  Nume agreed and dropped me off.<br>
  
<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>The Gymnasium was a wonder to behold.  There were three large crafted pools of water inside.  Also I could see a large group of beings gathered around a spot. As it turned out they were watching a single being fight about twelve different attackers.  She was kicking their ass! Rhys is a beautiful female with darkish skin.  Her ears are longer and even more pointed that an elf�s.  The thing that made her really stand out to me was the fact that her legs looked like that of a horse.  After watching her a bit I noticed that she also had a reptilian tail!  When I asked the person next to me who she was, he looked at me like I was insane. I told him that I was a �clueless�.  It got the response that I expected.  Everyone that had talked to since we arrive in these outer planes had all referred to us as �clueless�.  The guy suddenly understood and told me that her name was Rhys the Factol of the Transcendent Order.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>When I asked him what the Transcendent Order was, he told me that in order for the body to become one with the multiverse, then one must stop thinking and act. That action without thought was the purest form of thought.  From what I gathered he was talking about that a person can study their actions in relation to their surroundings to the point that they will gain a type of innate knowing of what to do next and when at such a quickness that it would appear to be without thought.  That you could, at some point, become one with yourself and everything around you.  Even to the point of being at one with everything.  Sounded REALLY interesting.   As I listened to him, more and more of what he said made a lot of sense.  I asked him what it would take to train there for the day.  He told me how they charge for daily lessons and pointed in the direction that I needed to go and wait for an instructor.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Needless to say, I did so.  The instructor was a female elf who showed me and everyone in the class, what she called, an ancient style of swordplay that elves hardly used anymore.  I pushed myself very hard and the teacher was rather impressed with my abilities at learned it.  After the class she asked me if I had given thought to joining the Transcendent Order.  I told her that I was thinking about it, but I had to think on it first.  She frowned in disappointment and wished me well.  I cannot help but think that I had said the wrong thing.  What they have said has been weighing greatly on my mind since.  I cannot help but feel that it is the right thing to do.  The next time we come back here I will definitely join.  I will endeavor to live by their ways to see if I can do it.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After the classes, I paid a sedan driver to take back to where I thought my friends would be.  They weren�t there but they were not far away.  I found then after a short time next to a fountain talking with some woman.  As I walked up, I saw Numenarh drinking something that she handed him.  Right afterward, as soon as he tried to say something, he started to sing.  Now I am not a one to say whether or not someone�s singing is good or not, but I will say this. What Numenarh sang, suited him greatly.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After he was through singing, the woman whispered into his ear and at first Nume started to smile but than he paled.  Everyone urged me to have her tell me future as well.  After seeing Nume�s reaction I was a bit skeptical.  But I did so.  She dipped the goblet into the water and handed it to me.  Upon reaching for the cup, I noticed this woman�s eyes.  Blackness.  But not just blackness, it was just absence of anything and everything. I put the goblet to my lips and drank the water deeply.  I also noticed that there appeared to be feathers, not in the water but inside the water.  I felt a warmth flow through me but nothing else.  As I was about to say that nothing was happening, I started to sing.<br></font><p align="left">


<font face="Monotype Corsiva">


<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>After my singing the lady leaned closer to me and whispered this:<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> �You will see an obex.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> �You will see wonders that others could only dream of.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> �You will see a people�s rise and fall.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> �You will go on quest in search of someone, but you will be disappointed in what you will find.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font> �You must beware of the secrets, yours will betray you.�<br></font><p align="left">

<font face="Monotype Corsiva">

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>Everyone, I noticed, shared theirs.  I kept silent for some reason.  I had a sense of foreboding with what she told me. I didn�t like it.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>It was not long after that when we decided to use the info that Julin and Quadro had gotten from the guy.  Numenarh, Quadro, Meepo, Nox and I used the feathers from the fountain to activate a portal that had been revealed to us by Kyrneth.  As I appeared back on Oerth in Celene. Only we appeared in someone�s dirty basement.  I do not know what I left with Nume to go back to Oerth right then.  I was going to go back and join the Ciphers.  I guess I identify with their way of thinking more than I thought.  I think that I like this way of being.  <br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>There is no reason to feel sorry of something that you have done.  I mean with the things that we have been going through, we do not have time to think about what we are doing anyway.  You must react without hesitation.  If I hesitate, I could get everyone killed or myself for that matter.  If you hesitate, you are second guessing yourself. And the Ciphers believe that when you think about what to do, you are second guessing yourself.<br>

<font color= "white">. . . . .</font>I find myself dwelling on these thoughts next to this campfire, and actually looking forward to the days to come.  For the more battles I am in, the closer I can come to being able to act without thought.  I see everything as a test now.  It�s very exciting.  Who knows.  Maybe sometime in the days to come I will be able to lift my chin up, keep my head held high, and see everyone be amazed.  =^_^=<br></font>

</a></center>
<p><font face="Monotype Corsiva">&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="white"><font face="Monotype Corsiva">. . . . .</font></font><font face="Monotype Corsiva">We arrived in Numenarh�s hometown
today. It�s called Hishn. A Slang word that means �speaking wolf�. Or
something like that. That is the problem with slang versions of words. Two
different areas can have a slightly different meaning for the same word. Hishn
is a nice sized town and really pretty. I like it here. Nume�s Dad seems a
little on the brash side. I can see where Nume get his dryness from. Haven�t
seen his mom around much.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>Quadro has proven to be his usual
non-thinking self by making himself a lot too much at home at Nume�s place. I
mean, really. To just walk into someone�s house without even knocking. How
insensitive can one person be. I guess that you would have to expect that from
an erkatam. Or Dwarf rather.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>Nume scared the crud out of me when we
entered his room and he was laying in his hammock style bed. I didn�t notice
how well built he was before. Mostly because his clothes were on. I think that
Nume is really starting to loosen up a lot more. He challenged me, for a reason
that I cannot think of, to unlock his door in order to get into his room. After
unlocking it, Quadro and I found him laying there in that hammock looking at a
painting that his brother had done. He showed us a black apple in the painting
that he had not noticed before. It looked a lot like one of the apples that was
given to Julin and Quadro by the Eye Guy.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>After puzzling over the painting a bit Nume
jumped out of his hammock-bed, startling me. I quickly turned around to avert my
eyes. He told me that he was not naked, but I didn�t believe him. I have never
seen a man naked before and was not about to now. It turned out that he had a
loin clothe on, which was good for me. I was still really uncomfortable and had
to leave the room.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>I think that Parenthay, Nume�s brother,
and Meepo are extremely good friends now. Meepo had cast fly on Paren and that
was all it took. To be honest, I do no think that Nume�s father, Tenzanier,
will be inviting us into his home any time soon. Numenarh was able to tell
Tenzanier about what happened to Menyoh. Tenzanier agreed that Nume should go to
her parents place and tell them as well. Quadro and I went into town to stay at
the inn they had there. Nox, being turned into a thing called a Lupinal decided
that it was best that he stay outside of town. I think that Nox wanted to get a
handle on his new form.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>Well, that is all for today. Tomorrow I
think that I will dress a little more conservative. Heck, I think I will try on
the outfit that Nox suggested. Looks comfortable.<br>

It will be about five days travel from the morning. Numenarh�s a little on the
quiet side. I guess seeing Menyoh�s parents and talking with them has reopened
old wounds. Poor Numenarh, going through so much and still he keeps on going.
How does he do it?<br>

<p><font color="white"><font face="Monotype Corsiva">. . . . .</font></font><font face="Monotype Corsiva">Upon setting camp today Nume scared the
crap out of me again. Nox and I were sparring so that I show off what I had
learned at the Gymnasium in Sigil. Just as Nox was attacking me I saw Numenarh
all bloodied up and got punched in the side of the head. I�ll tell you
something, Nox hits HARD! I rushed over to Nume and he assured me that
everything was all right, that he had hunted and got us all something to eat.
Kind of disgusting, what with the blood and all. As Nox and I squared off again
to continue training, Nume suggested that we not do that for what if we were
attacked by a huge boar or something. He could have gone � well forever
without bringing that up again. Damn horse pig.<br>

<p><font face="Monotype Corsiva">&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="white"><font face="Monotype Corsiva">. . . . .</font></font><font face="Monotype Corsiva">Well, I have to say this. TODAY WAS HELL!
Today started fairly decent then went straight down from there. We arrived in
Rastor to find Rask, Drak, and Julin there waiting on us. Julin had found out
some very interesting info that Dwarves had moved back into the Temple and
started to mine it. Boy those Erkatams� don�t waste any time do they? Quadro
also found out that the scroll shop lady had closed her shop and moved to be
with her kind in the mines. Most likely to help them and what have you.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>We didn�t waste much time either heading
out to the temples either. Quadro thought that it was a good idea to go through
the front entrance. As it happens every time, and we still have not learned yet,
we were fired upon with a ballista through a hatch in the doors. Julin was the
one hit by it, too. Numenarh yelled out for me to climb through the hole to the
inside and move away the bar. I did so and found myself surrounded by an ogre,
two gnolls, and a human riding a howler. How he rode it comfortably, I have not
a clue.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>Anyway, I got hurt really bad by the ogre
and the man on the howler. Hurt to the point that I was fearful for my life. I
tumbled to what I thought was a safe distance so that I could heal myself and be
able to help better. After downing a curing potion I saw that Nume had tried to
climb through the hole as well, only his large frame made it to where he got
stuck. Just then, the bar that was holding the door exploded. That could have
only been Nox. I saw him use that, I guess, spell several times before. That was
how Quadro was able to burst in and cast some sort of spell that made glowing
blue balls appear in his hands and threw them at the bad guys. It wasn�t long
after that when we won the battle. Not one of our more glamorous victories, but
we still won.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>After that, it was back to the old routine
of Nox and me scouting ahead. What we found was a room filled with corpses just
standing inside of a closet. Yeah, they were zombies. We were making short work
of them until Rask caught up to us. After he caught up it lasted MUCH short. He
literally blew them away. He just raised his symbol and they exploded into dust.
Caused me to start a sneezing fit.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>We scouted again and we came up to an area
that smelled really bad. After looking around Nox and I found out that there
were troglodytes guarding an area. Nox found that there were two troglodytes in
a living area. When we alerted the others, a plan was hatched that sounded so
absurd that we thought that it just had to work. It did. Now run up to the
doorway and held Meepo in while Meepo cast a fireball into the room. When we
check though we found that there were actually three and they were all three
dead.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>We found some magical stuff that included a
pair of magical boots. We discussed who would be the best person to get them and
when I said what I thought was a very logical opinion, Julin becomes a real
asshole and says that I just wanted the boots without paying anyone. Or
something really close to that. It was something to the effect that I was being
selfish. My argument was that since Nox was faster that I was, that in my
opinion it would have been better for me to use the boots than Nox. Be the way,
the Boots made a person move more silently. Seeing as how I am now more apt than
anyone to be more silent than anyone. If I were to use the boots then I would be
able to scout better. IF Nox wore them then he would be as quiet as I am without
them. I think that dying has had a bad effect on Julin. Anyway what happened
with the boots was that Julin pitched a fit about them and had them given to Nox.
Nox then gave them to me as a gift. You could almost taste the sourness from
Julin.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>Further on down, Nox and I found more
troglodytes that seemed to be on guard. There must be something of real
importance in this area for there to be all of these guards. Seeing as how there
were only two there, Nox and I decided to surprise attack them and just take
them out. NOPE! Not going to work like that. As soon as I got maybe twenty-five
to thirty feet from them, I suddenly got this incredibly nauseous feeling and
started vomiting. Of course this spoils the surprise attack and they attack.
Well evidently I did such a good job hiding that I was not even looked at during
that battle, either that or I didn�t pose any kind of a threat.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>Anyway we won that battle and acquired the
Sword of Air. Nox asked for the Sword of Earth since he was the only one that
could use a great sword. After being given it, he basically sold the Sword of
Fire to Julin. Good, now there are four of us that have good range capabilities.
Through Julin�s Recall Tale, he was able to discern what the Sword of Earth
did and how to use its abilities. These sword are really good. I wonder what the
Sword of Water will look like.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>Well, we have made camp now and I find
myself wondering what tomorrow will bring for my friends and me. I know this,
though, it will not be a dull time. Until tomorrow, Stacia. Goodnight.<br>
</font><p><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><font color="white">. . . . .</font>We were attacked again! This guys have a
total lack of honor. They keep attacking us while we are resting. That�s just
not right. Maybe we should see how they like it. Anyway we were attacked by
three trogs and some really weird looking creatures. One of the two other kinds
of creature I recognized from the tales from the men that would come to
Jeleket�s Roost. Two athochs; huge ugly giants types that have three arms. One
of which is sticking out the middle of its chest. The other type of creature was
called xorns. Two of those, as well. Nume told me briefly about the xorns; they
eat metal. Magical metal is what the xorn prefer.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>The athochs had incredible reach, the Trogs
were able to cast spells, and the xorn were able to meddle into the stone.
Despite all of these obstacles, we were able to overcome the enemy. We all
seemed to pull together and fight as a team even better than normally. Though I
could tell that Nume was being a little to careful. Not that I blame him one
bit. Hell, he is the only one of the original members of this group that has not
died. May the gods bless him and keep death from him. Anyway, we won that fight,
too. You would think that these temple guys would know better by now.<br>
<font color="white">. . . . .</font>So here we are attempting to rest again. I
have noticed something that I did not notice before. I have noticed that Nume
has a nice butt. Now do not get me wrong. The thing that scares me is that I
noticed it by Rask staring at Numenarh�s rear end whenever Nume�s back is
facing him. Now even though I lived with humans for the first part of my life, I
have not noticed anything like that. I have never seen a male look at another
male�s butt like Rask is doing right now. I wonder if Nume knows. EWWW! Does
this mean what I think it means? EWW! That is just SICK! =^_^</font>

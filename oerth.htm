<p><strong><span style='font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext'>The
Basics of Oerth<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext'>Heavens and Oerth<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>The world of Greyhawk
encompasses the Flanaess, the easternmost portion of the vast continent of
Oerik, on the sphere of Oerth. Scholars from the Flanaess are certain that
Oerik is the greatest of the Oerth's four continents, and that four great
oceans surround these lands, as do four layers of the heavens, and four depths
of the Underworld. Almost nothing is known of the lands beyond the Flanaess,
and little is understood of the regions above &amp; below. Such knowledge is of
little importance, claim the high &amp; mighty, for clearly the lands around
the great city of Greyhawk form the center of all enlightenment and
civilization.</span></strong><span style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>Oerth is but one
world among many, separated either by the gulfs of space, the invisible ether,
or the fragile viels of reality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
craft and persistence of magic defines the nature of Oerth.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Throughout recorded history, magical
conflict and restoration have shaped this world.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Some of these magic-driven events touch upon the history of other
worlds, and portals sometimes open between Oerth and alien spheres.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Few other worlds most the magical profundity
of Oerth, and many strange beings are found there, drawn by the lure of the
supernatural. The majority of such entities make their homes far from the
sunlight skies of Oerth's surface, preferring to live secretly in the lightless
caverns below, where they may thrive &amp; plot unseen.</span></strong><span
style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>If the paths of
the underworld are hidden from view, the wise may still turn their attentions
to the heavens. All know that the sun travels once around Oerth every 364 days
- passing through the 12 lairs of the Zodiac in an appointed round that never
varies. The pale Great Moon, called Luna, waxes &amp; wanes in fixed cycles of
28 days each, upon which the months are based. The aquamarine lesser moon,
Celene, follows a slower path, revealing her full beauty only four times a
year, thus showing the time for civilized festivals.<span style="mso-spacerun:

days long, with work rest &amp; worship practiced as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:24.0pt'>Climate &amp;
Seasons <o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p><span style='color:windowtext'>The Flanaess is exceptionally blessed in
regard to its weather. Outside of the northern latitudes, the winter
temperatures seldom fall below freezing, except during the two winter months,
and at night during early spring &amp; later autumn. In the depths of winter
some a few days when the temperature reaches the freezing point, then gradual
warming begins. The northeast and north central regions tend to be considerably
colder, for the seas of those regions cause winter to linger about twice as
long as it does in the heartland of the Flanaess. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:windowtext'>An important exception to this is the Dramidj
Ocean, whose strange warm currents moderate the climate of the lands that
border it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Autumn, winter, and spring are rather short seasons, but
summer in the central Flanaess lasts five or more months. Most areas of the
Flanaess have sufficient rainfall to ensure abundant crops.</p>

<h1><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:24.0pt'>Geography of the
Flanaess<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p><span style='color:windowtext'>View a map of the whole<a
href="http://mypage.uniserve.ca/~rweston/greyhawk/images/LG_Map_Full.jpg"> Flanaess</a><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:windowtext'>The Flanaess can be divided into nine broadly
defined geopolitical territories, most of which coincide with old national
identities that once dominated those regions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Baklunish West
(Former Baklunish Empire)<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><span style='color:windowtext'>Survivors of the Invoked Devastation settled
these temperate prairies, forests &amp; coastal lands a thousand years ago.
Largely seperated from the rest of the Flanaess by the great Yatils, Barrier
Peaks &amp; Crystalmist Mountains, these realms are a stronghold of Baklunish
Culture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Bitter North<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><span style='color:windowtext'>The lands north of the Yatil Mountains, from
the Dramidj Coast to the Dulsi River make up the Bitter North. A land of
forests and steppes, this cold land is home to nomads &amp; sparse settlements
of goblins &amp; orcs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Western Nyr Dyv
(Old Perrenland)<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><span style='color:windowtext'>The lands from the Nyr Dyv to the Yatils have
long been home to the kingdoms of Flan, Oeridians, Dwarves &amp; elves. Rich
farmland, pleasant climate combined with healthy trade relations with their
neighbours in the east, south &amp; west have made this a strong &amp; wealthy
region.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Sheldomar Valley
(Old Keoland)<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><span style='color:windowtext'>This fertile valley is almost completely
enclosed by mountains until it reaches the Azure Sea. Warm &amp; mild, the
valley is home to many elves, dwarves, gnomes &amp; halflings, living in peace
alongside Suel, Flan &amp; Oeridian farmers &amp; lords.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Empire of Iuz
(Northern Reaches)<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><span style='color:windowtext'>The evil demigod Iuz has expanded his
territory from his original realm north of lake Whyestil to include most of the
land from the western edge of the Vesve Forest &nbsp; across the north-central
Flanaess to the current war-zone of Tehn. These cool lands are generally
wilderness dotted with ruined human towns &amp; active orc lairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Thillonrian
Peninsula (Barbarian North)<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><span style='color:windowtext'>This isolated, mountainous region at the
northeastern edge of the Flanaess is home to many Suel barbarians. This is a
rugged land of high mountains, forests and deep fjords, with rocky soil and a
brief growing season.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Old Aerdy West <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><span style='color:windowtext'>These lands between the eastern Nyr Dyv and
the southern Rakers are temperate &amp; fertile. Huamns of Flan, Oeridian &amp;
Suloise heritage dwell in relative harmony here. This area was once part of the
Oeridian-dominated Great Kingdom, but it broke away to form the kingdom of
Nyrond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Old Aerdy East<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><span style='color:windowtext'>The lands of the Solonor Coast, south &amp;
east of the rakers and north of the Vast swamp were once the heartland of
Aerdy, the Great Kingdom. These lands are rich and their climate pleasant,
though long years of cvivil war andoppression have damaged the economy. Many
orcs &amp; goblinoid races live amung the numerous warlike oeridians who dwell
here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Isolated Realms<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>These strange lands include the deadly Sea of Dust, the
jungles of Amedio and Hepmonaland, the Tilvanot Peninsula, and many islands
along the eastern coast. These regions are little known to most inhabitants of
the Flanaess. Suloise peoples are found throughout these lands, particulairly
on the Tilvanot Peninsula.</p>

<h4>The Races of Greyhawk</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h2><strong><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt'>Human
Races:</span></u></strong><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt;font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></u></h2>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>The importance of
the racial mixes varies from region to region. The Suloise are the most jealous
of their purebloodedness, perhaps reflecting their distinct differences from
all other races and their history of being driven out of the main Flanaess
lands (by the Oeridians, in particular). The Scarlet Botherhood are Suloise
racists, but such racism is rare. Although other groups may take strong pride
in being much like their original ancestors, as the Tenhas do, those around
them often do not react favorablyto this (as reflected in the fall of Tenh). </span></strong><span
style='color:windowtext'><br>
<br>
<strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>In the central Flanaess in particular,
little attention is paid to skin color or racial ancestry, although there is
growing tendency to regard Suel folk with suspicion (not least because of the
rose of the Scarlet Brotherhood). There are more important divisions within the
lands to worry about in these times. Who cares whether the pikeman standing
next to you is Oeridian or Baklunish, if the enemy is a hobgoblin or a fiend in
the service of Iuz? </span></strong><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Human -
Backlunish</span></strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt;font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>The Baklunish people
have golden-hued skins, gray-green or green eyes, and hair ranging from dark
brown to blue-black. The lands of Ekbir, the Tiger Nomads, Ull, and Zeif around
the Drawmij Ocean are home to this pure Baklunish strain. Farther east, racial
mixing results in modified appearances: the Wolf Nomads are Baklunish mixed
with Flan (from the Rovers of the Barrens), and have correspondingly darker
features. In Ket, mixing with both Oeridian and Suloise folk gave rise to folk
with pale yellow or golden-brown/tan skin. </span></strong><span
style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Human
-Flannae</span></strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;
font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>The original human
occupants of the Flanaess had bronze complexions varying from coppery tones to
deep brown. Their eyes were dark brown, even black, or rarely amber. Likewise,
their hair was always dark brown or black. The Flan are now scattered to the
winds. The Rovers of the Barrens have no land to call their own; the Tenhas,
pure Flan and proud of it, are enslaved by Iuz or have fled to the south; the
Flan folk of Geoff anf Sterich have likewise fled south and east from their
homes. </span></strong><span style='color:windowtext'><br>
<br>
<strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>In the Theocracy of the Pale,
Flan/Oerid descendants are lighter of skin and hair than pure Flan, and are a
handsome people. Perhaps within a handful of generations, almost all Flan blood
will be found only in such blends. </span></strong><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Human
-Oeridians: </span></strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt;font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>The Oeridians have
fairly dark skins, varying from tan to olive colors, but their hair color runs
the range from honey blond to black, with brown and auburn the most common.
Their eye colors are likewise variable. Pure Oeridian stock is thus less easy
to spot with the casual eye than most races, but it can be seen most readily in
Furyondy, Perrenland, and in the east and south of the Great Kingdom. </span></strong><span
style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Human
-Suloise: </span></strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt;font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>The Suel were
scattered to the margins of the Flanaess in the distant past, so it is small
wonder that most Suel blood has been intermized with other racial groups. The
Suel are fairskinned, some being almost albino, with red or blond (even
platinum blond) hair and blue, gray, or violet eyes. The barbarian peoples of
the northeast are the purest example of original Suel stock, but the Suel also
dominate the Scarlet Brotherhood and the eastern islands of the Aerdi Sea. </span></strong><span
style='color:windowtext'><br>
<br>
<strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>On the main continent, the Duchy of
Urnst has the largest (proportionately) enclave of Suloise. Anomalous
populations of Suloise are found in Hepmonaland and the Amedio Jungle; while
many have developed tanned skins with heavy freckling, pale and albino faces
that look utterly incongruous in the steaming jungles can still be seen. </span></strong><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt'>Demihumans of
the Flanaess: <o:p></o:p></span></u></h2>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>Habits of the
demihuman races are another matter. As one would expect, elven folk are found
in woodland and forest, dwarves in hills and mountains, and so on. Demihumans
are also drawn generally to major Free Cities such as Dyvers and Greyhawk. And
there are certain lands in which demihumans are of major importance. </span></strong><span
style='color:windowtext'><br>
<br>
<strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The major elf-ruled lands are those of
Celene (gray and wood elves), the Duchy of Ulek (wood and high elves), and
Lendore (aquatic and high elves). Mountain dwarves dominate Irongate and the
Principality of Ulek and are numerous in Ratik. The lands of Ulek, Urnst,
Sunndi, Highfolk (especially), and the Valley of the Mage (a unique case) are
dominated by mixes of demihumans. Veluna has always had a strong population of
high elves and gnomes, and the Gran March and Keoland have had their ranks
swelled by high elves and mountain dwarves fleeing Geoff and Sterich. </span></strong><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Dwarves
(Dwur): </span></strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;
font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>Dwarves of the
Flanaess are strong and stubborn people. In some lands, they need help, but are
often too proud to ask for it outright; beseiged Irongate, the exiled mountain
dwarves driven into the Good Hills of Keoland, and the Ulek dwarves who
suffered at the hands of the Pomarj humanoids are all examples. Some of these
clans feel themselves to have been wronged; the Ulek dwarves are angry with the
elves of Celene for not giving them aid, and these is strain between them and
the elven-dominates Duchy of Ulek, which sympathizes with the dwarves and yet
dares not rebuke Celene openly. Elsewhere, the strong mountain folk are better
placed; in Urnst, which has emerged strong after the war, dwarves are learning
that the old glory of Nyrond needs their help even to sustain its own shadow.
In Sunndi, the dwarves ally with the elves and gnomes, each experts at
defending their own terrains, to keep their enemies at bay. </span></strong><span
style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Elves
(Olve): </span></strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;
font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>Elves of the
Flanaess are more divided. Bright Veluna has a strong elven presence that works
unstintingly for good. Nyrond and Furyondy elves are vigilant against evil. The
elves of the Highfolk bow no knee to Iuz, but the rulers of Celene are divided
and currently favor isolationism. In Sunndi, the gray elves are warlike,
aggressive, and hostile; in Lendore, the dominant high elves are philosophers,
mystics, and otherwordly. There is no simple racial division within the elves,
either; it is not the</span></strong><span style='color:windowtext'><br>
<strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>case that high elves are more inclined
to be actively opposed to the evil of the Flanaess than gray or wood elves.
What can one say of this timeless people? Some are the greatest hope of the
Flanaess, while some seem to do nothing as the world threatens to collapse
about them. </span></strong><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Gnomes
(Noniz): </span></strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;
font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>Gnomes take a
similar view. Their hilly homes have been threatened by the humanoids in
particular; many have been driven into the plains of human dominated lands
where they seek help to re-establish their old heartlands. Many, too, co-exist
with elves in the woodlands; where the elves are active in working with human
interests, so are the gnomes. Hill gnomes often share living space with dwarves,
and are a brave, tough folk who are loyal to their neighbors and fight side by
side with them. </span></strong><span style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Halflings
(Hobniz): </span></strong><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt;font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>Halflings
typically identify strongly with the good nations of the Flanaess. They are not
numerous, and have no lands of their own. It is not surprising that they look
to the larger folk (and other demihumans) for protection and alliances. </span></strong><span
style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><strong><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt'>Humanoids:
</span></u></strong><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt;
font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></u></h2>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>The humanoid races
of the Flanaess have historically been driven into the least favorable areas -
mountains, hills, barren plains, swamps, and marshlands. However, three lands
are now dominated by them. The Bone March is home to orcs, ogres, and gnolls;
the Pomarj is the habitat of the same races, together with bugbears; and the
Lost Lands (previously the Grand Duchy of Geoff and Sterich) have been overrun
by ogres, giants, hobgoblins, and other humanoids. Iuz, of course, has many
humanoids</span></strong><span style='color:windowtext'><br>
<strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>within his lands. <o:p></o:p></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>There is no common
factor that unites these marauding monsters. The orcs of the Pomarj have no
alliance and no communication with the orcs of the Bone March, for example.
Even the priesthoods of the same orcish deities have virtually no
communication. The humanoids are a rabble, but that makes then no less
dangerous. </span></strong><span style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h4>The Languages of the Flanaess</h4>

<p style='margin-right:.5in'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;color:windowtext'>Most
scholars agree that only five of the countless dialects of Eastern Oerik were
or are spoken by enough people to be properly called languages. These are:
Common, Ancient Baklunish, Suloise, Old Oeridian, and Flan<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in'><b><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;

when the Rain of Colorless Fire destroyed the Suloise Empire. Today it is
rarely spoken, even among the few scholars who know the tongue; rather, it
exists in its written state for the sake of those who would delve into the
survivindg arcane tomes of the Suel peoples.</span><span style='color:windowtext'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in'><b><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;

true form remains unknown. Entire cities and countless people were purged from
Oerth, leaving few signs of the great civilization that thrived from the
Sulhaut Mountains to the Dramidj Ocean. In retaliation, a cadre of Baklunish
wizard-clerics, gathered in the great protective stone circles known as Tovag
Baragu, brought the Rain of Colorless Fire upon their hated enemies. The skies
above the Suel Imperium opened, and all beings and things beneath this shining
rift in the heavens were burned into ash. So terribly did these attacks plague

eastward in search of their ultimate destiny. They were the first large group
to enter the lands of the fan, which they termed the Flanaess. Suloise refugees
soon followed, sometimes working with the Oeridians to pacify the land, but
more often warring with them over which race would dominate it. For over two
centuries, Suel and Oeridian fought for control of the region from the
Crystalmists to the Solnor Coast. Many Suloise were debased and wicked, and

tribes, the Aerdi, reached the Flanmi River. From there they spread outward
again, conquering indigenous peoples and fellow migrants alike. In time, the
kingdom of Aerdy ruled the whole of the eastern Flanaess and moved its borders
westward. One hundred and ten years after the defeat of the last meaningful
threat to Aerdi sovereignty, at the Battle of a Fortnight's Length, the leader
of Aerdy was crowned as overking of the Great Kingdom. Overking Nasran also
marked the birth of a new calendar, and with the Declaration of Universal
Peace, the sun arose in the east on the first day of the first Common Year. The
writ of imperial Aerdy eventually encompassed holdings as far west as the
Yatils, controlling the southern Nyr Dyv with a small garrison at an

Celestial House of Rax, had grown especially decadent.<span

declared itself free of the Great Kingdom and elected one of its nobles as king

<h1>The Ivids and Iuz</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The darkest chapter in the history of Aerdy began in 437 CY.
In this year, the upstart House Naelax murdered the Rax overking, inaugurating
a series of gruesome civil wars called the Turmoil Between Crowns. Within a
decade, Ivid I of Naelax was recognized as the undisputed overking of all
Aerdy. As Ivid was rumored to be in league with powerful evil Outsiders, the
Malachite Throne of the Great Kingdom became known as the Fiend-Seeing Throne,
and the once mighty and upright empire became a bastion of evil and cruelty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The lands of the Flanaess soon became acquainted with an
altogether less subtle form of evil with the rise of Iuz, in the Northern
Reaches loosely aligned with Furyondy. In 479 CY, a minor despot in the Howling
Hills left his domain to his &quot;son,&quot; a being known as Iuz. Within a
handful of years, Iuz had conquered his neighbors, setting up a small realm for
himself. Tales told by refugees entering Furyondy spoke of unmitigated evil:
Iuz was building a road of human skulls from the Howling Hills to his capital,
Dorakaa. Worse, divinations and rumors marked Iuz as the offspring of an unholy
union between necromancer and the demon Grazzt; he was seen to be a half-fiend
towering 7 feet in height, driven by a thirst for blood, destruction, and
conquest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Political struggles within Furyondy prevented the king from
acting decisively in this period, when the evil of Iuz might have been
permanently checked. Instead, the cambion lord flourished until 505 CY, when he
appeared to vanish from Oerth. In truth, Iuz was imprisoned beneath Castle
Greyhawk by the Mad Archmage Zagig Yragerne, former lord mayor of Greyhawk. In
Iuz's absence, orc tribes and disloyal former subjects squabbled for control of
his land, allowing the forces of weal to rest for a time. Three developments
kept Furyondy and its allies from complacency. First, part of Iuz's leaderless
realm soon broke away to be ruled by a nearly equal evil, the Horned Society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second, the notorious Horde of Elemental Evil arose, a
collection of cultists and villains headquartered at a temple south of the town
of Verbobonc. The Horde was the puppet of Zuggtmoy, Iuz's abyssal consort, who
instructed it in bizarre teachings at the behest of her absent lover. The
Horde's banditry was finally vanquished in 569 CY at the Battle of Emridy
Meadows, where Prince Thrommel of Furyondy led forces from Furyondy, Veluna,
Verbobonc, and other realms in victory and the destruction of the temple.
Adventurers put down an attempted resurgence of the Temple of Elemental Evil in
579 CY.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Third, faithful orc and human servants of Iuz became zealots
dedicated to their absent lord. In time, the leaders of these cults devoted to
Iuz displayed magical power, igniting Furyondy's worst fears. In 570 CY, a
meddlesome warrior-adventurer named Lord Robilar freed Iuz from his
imprisonment. Iuz returned to his lands more powerful and wicked than ever
before, with an unholy priesthood leading his forces in his unholy name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The years from Iuz's return to the Greyhawk Wars (570~581)
are often seen in retrospect to be the prelude to later conflict. Several
destabilizing forces came into play, upsetting the old balance of power in the
Flanaess. The most insidious of these powers was the Scarlet Brotherhood, a
secretive monastic order first reported in 570 CY, the same year in which
Prince Thrommel of Furyondy, hero of Emridy Meadows, vanished from the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Semiregular skirmishes between Aerdy's South Province and
Nyrond erupted into open hostilities in early 579, when Overking Ivid V made
war against the so-called &quot;Golden League&quot; (Nyrond, Almor, and the
Iron League). Though this dreary war lasted through to the end of 580, it
resolved nothing except to drain the coffers and manpower of both Aerdy and
Nyrond, leaving them weakened when continental war erupted in 583.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The ravaging of the
Shield Lands by both the Bandit Kingdoms and Horned Society in 579-583 CY
similarly served to weaken this entire region, leaving the Shield Lands in
ruins. Iuz took note of this and made use of it in his grandiose plans for
conquest. An important though seldom noticed event took place in 581 CY, when
an agent of Vecna, the Whispered One of ancient Flan legend, struck down the
entire Circle of Eight (see Chapter Six). The Circle had acted subtly as a
balancing agent for years, preventing any one power from dominating too much of
the Flanaess. Though the Circle's leader, Mordenkainen, returned his colleagues
to life using powerful magic, the group was in disarray when war again erupted
in the distant north in 582.</p>

<h1>The Greyhawk Wars</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 582 CY, the god Vatun appeared to his subjects among the
barbarian tribes of the Thillonrian Peninsula. Ancient legend predicted that
the return of Vatun, who had vanished centuries ago, would signal the birth of
a barbarian empire in the north. Unfortunately, this particular
&quot;Vatun&quot; was actually Iuz, whipping the northmen into a war frenzy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The barbarians invaded the Hold of Stonefist, which allied
with them after Iuz ensorcelled Sevvord Redbeard, the Master of the Hold. The
combined host then smashed through the Griffs and into the duchy of Tenh, which
was swiftly overwhelmed. The barbarian alliance soon crumbled, but the damage
was done: Tenh and Stonefist belonged to the Old One. Returning to his
homeland, Iuz then conquered the Horned Society, Bandit Kingdoms, and Shield
Lands in quick succession. Furyondy was invaded, and much of its northern
territory was captured and laid waste. Iuz held the northern Flanaess in a
death grip. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Taking advantage of the chaos, Ivid V ordered the Great
Kingdom's armies to muster, with the intention of paying back his foes for
centuries of impudence. The war that followed was staggering in scope and
consequence. Almor was utterly destroyed; Nyrond was invaded; Sunndi was
conquered. The nobles of the Great Kingdom fell upon one another, terrified of
their insane overking and eager to steal the lands of their neighbors. In the
chaos, Medegia was despoiled and Rel Astra attacked by the Great Kingdom's own
military. Ivid attempted to ensure loyalty by having his generals and nobles
assassinated and reanimated as intelligent undead (animuses), with all the
abilities they possessed in life. He in turn was also assassinated, though the
church of Hextor restored him to undead &quot;life,&quot; after which he became
a true monster known as Ivid the Undying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The madness of war bred more war. In 584, south of Greyhawk,
a half-orc named Turrosh Mak united the vile nonhuman tribes of the Pomarj.
Mak's armies boiled north, conquering several of the cities of the independent
Wild Coast, then capturing nearly half of the Principality of Ulek. The appeals
of Prince Corond of Ulek to Yolande, the elven queen of Celene, fell upon
uncaring ears. Celene closed its borders to even its most trusted allies,
refusing to let elfblood fall in human wars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This same year, decade-old paranoia regarding the Scarlet
Brotherhood came true, as advisers in courts throughout the Flanaess were found
to be Brotherhood agents. The Lordship of the Isles, Idee, Onnwal, and the Sea
Princes fell under the influence of the Scarlet Sign, from treachery or
invasion. Barbarians from Hepmonaland and the Amedio Jungle were used to secure
captured lands. The Brotherhood was revealed as an evil, racist order dedicated
to preserving the culture and puriry of the ancient Suel Imperium, without
regard to the lives of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For three years, the whole of the Flanaess flew banners of
war. Nations fell as new empires were born. Demons and devils from the Outer Planes
were summoned en masse by Iuz and Ivid the Undying, and hundreds of thousands
of mortals died. Finally, the battle-weary combatants gathered in Greyhawk to
declare peace. Harvester 584 CY was to see the signing of the Pact of Greyhawk,
fixing borders and mandating an end to hostilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the Day of the Great Signing, however, Greyhawk suffered
a great treachery: Rary, one of the Circle of Eight, destroyed his companions
Tenser and Otiluke in a great magical battle, then fled. Many suspected that the
former Archmage of Ket had hoped to hold the ambassadors hostage, perhaps
capturing Greyhawk itself in the process. Instead, he and his cohort, Lord
Robilar, went to the Bright Desert to form their own kingdom. Fearing further
disruptions, the delegates hurriedly signed the Pact of Greyhawk. Ironically,
because of the site of the treaty signing, the great conflicts soon became
known as the Greyhawk Wars.</p>

<h1>Recent Recovery</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Year of Peace&quot; (585 CY) saw little of the sort.
War raged in the Principality of Ulek against orc invaders from the Pomai, and
efforts to retake Sterich were initiated in the west. The Circle of Eight was
brought to full membership once more and began acting against every power its
wizards perceived as tyrannical or dangerous to the common welfare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the fall of 585 CY, King Archbold III of Nylond was
almost assassinated by his younger son, Sewarndt. Fighting erupted in the
capital, but Archbold's eldest son, Lynwerd, won the day, taking the throne in
Fireseek 586. In 587, King Lynwerd incorporated much of ruined Almor into
Nyrond, but he now struggles to maintain his tottering realm in the face of
staggering difficulties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Coldeven 586, Canon Hazen of Veluna employed the Crook of
Rao, a powerful artifact, in a special ceremony that purged the Flanaess of
nearly all fiends inhabiting it. Outsiders summoned by Iuz, Ivid, or
independent evils fell victim to this magical assault, which became known as
the Flight of Fiends. King Belvor III of Furyondy quickly joined Canon Hazen in
declaring the Great Northern Crusade, an ambitious military action aimed at
regaining land lost to Iuz during the Greyhawk Wars. By the end of 588 CY, the
armies of Furyondy had restored the nation, as well as Critwall and Scragholme
Isle in the old Shield Lands. The destruction and debauchery revealed as Iuz's
agents fled sickened the crusaders. King Belvor declared eternal war upon the
Old One, pledging to settle for nothing short of the complete destruction of
Iuz himself. Raids against Iuz from Furyondy and the Shield Lands continue to
the present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wars on the border of Iuz's empire burned in the east as
well. Iuz's control over the ruler of Stonehold ended in 588. Swiftly
afterward, a many-sided war began in Tenh, involving the mutually hostile
forces o fIuz, Stonehold, the Pale, and Tenha expatriates. The war goes on
today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Immediately after the Flight of Fiends, it was announced in
Rauxes that Ivid V was no longer overking, though it was unclear if he had
actually died. Conflict engulfed the capital in a matter of hours as many of
Ivid's generals and nobles, filled with rage and ambition, marched upon Rauxes.
No one can explain the events that followed, but the city itself was soon
engulfed in a strange magical field. Few willingly approach Rauxes now, given
the bizarre eldritch forces that prevail where the ruined city stands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The provinces of the broken Great Kingdom are now reunited,
but into two mutually hostile powers. In 586 CY, Herzog Grenell of North
Province declared himself overking of the Great Kingdom of Northern Aerdy.
Overking Xavener I rules the United Kingdom of Ahlissa (founded in 587) from
his new capital of Kalstrand. Both leaders would like to destroy each other,
but financial problems and internal power struggles have forced them to devote
their energies toward rebuilding their armies and infrastructure. Sunndi, the
largest surviving member of the Iron League, became a kingdom in 589. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Scarlet Brotherhood gained much in the Greyhawk Wars but
suffered later reversals. In 586, the people of Onnwal rose up against their
occupiers, reducing the brotherhood's holdings to the capital, Scant. Idee was
lost to Ahlissa in 587, and the Hold of the Sea Princes collapsed in a bloody
civil war that began in 589 CY. Still, the Lordship of the Isles remains under
the Scarlet Sign, and agents of the Brotherhood creep into courts across the
Flanaess, sowing their evil plots. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Flanaess today stands on the verge of a dynamic new age.
The last decade has seen terrific wan, refugee migrations, the rise and fall of
whole nations. The exploration of foreign lands is on the rise, trade is
surging upward once more, and opportunities for heroism (and profits) are
unlimited. The Flanaess awaits those who would seize its adventures and shape
its future</p>

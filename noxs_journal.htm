<p align="left"><b>Entry I</b></p>
<p align="left">    Recorded for the future generations.- My travels have brought me much understanding of the workings of a team.<br>
Rather than continue with a pictoral representation of our travels, I have decided to adapt the way of those I travel with. Perhaps this will further aid my quest for self-perfection, if I become a part of the group as a whole.<br>
<br>
    My travels have placed me into a group with individuals of various races and professions. The skills and abilities of each compliment each other, forming a strong group overall. This is part of the way. I know little of my companions,
their lives to this point being largely unspoken of. But they have, in part, earned my trust, and I feel no discomfort writing around them now. What paths in life bring together such a group as this? By my best account,
I would say the return of the dark god. But, the group seems to ignore the urgency of the situation. While I do no
think we should go unprepared against such a foe, I do find that time is of the essence in dealing with this threat. The destruction of the final alter brought some comfort. But at what price?<br>
<br>
<br>
Mee-Poe. I feel a certain kinship with the small reptile. His spells have proved useful in the fighting, though I fear my companions see him as little more than a weapon. A tool to use as they see fit. He is spoken to infrequently, and oft sits alone. I wonder what thoughts fill his head. Few places we travel to greet him with anything more than suspicion or outright hatred. In part, this is why I have chosen to remain in this lupine form. It seems to provoke more of a reaction than the small one's. Granted, my
Githzeari form was not accepted readily either. But, this one is a bit more drastic. Perhaps this will bring Mee-poe a small comfort, in some
way. He has more than proven his value to the group as a whole. I must speak with him more often. I also must learn, as I feel should my companions, that the small one IS part of the group. They have known him longer than I.....<br>
<br>
Rask. For a cleric of a heavenly power, Rask does seem a bit self-serving. Rare is the occasion he invokes his holy power to assist another without some prodding or outright begging, unless something needs to be made dead. The power he wields cannot be denied, however, and on many occasion has he removed our lard from the forge. it is a bit unnerving how his eyes focus when glancing Nu-m'nar's direction.  Several times recently he has awakened to the sound of ghostly bells, which no other has heard. His recent actions have lead me to believe there is something going on in his mind, that if not halted, could very well lead to the destruction of the party. perhaps it is not only the cleric who should be praying.....<br>
<br>
<br>
Drak. The druidic Drak has recently departed the group for reasons unclear to me. I
wish him the best whatever his path. perhaps one day, he shall return to adventure with us once again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nu-M'nar. Never have I seen one who possesses such skill with a bow as Nu-M'nar. Few
are the times his arrows fail to find their mark. Even for one of his race, his skill is impressive. Sadly, skill with a bow seems to be the extent of his combat abilities. Should ever he be caught without
one... I dare not say. thankfully, the bow he possesses is truly a work of art.
His outspoken nature, combined with his prowess, should allow him to take up arms as leader of the town of Rastor, should he intend to. He seems to be bent on bringing the town to some sort of peace. I wish him the best, and will assist in any way I can to bring law to the town. Regardless, Nu-M'nar is quite an asset to the team. many times has it been he who has delivered the felling shot to our enemies. I am proud to call him compatriot.<br>
<br>
Julen. Self serving opportunistic heartless bastard.  His brand of evil is needed in this party more than anyone else. Not to say he is evil. You know of what
I speak, though. His viewpoint causes CONSTANT conflict, his harsh tone does not befit one of his chosen profession. many of the clueless find him charming, mesmerizing. I however, have seen planar things. And yet, there is an undeniable charm to his grating views. Life to him is not optimistic. It's real, harsh. Untainted by the
experiences he has had. And I welcome his words. His songs are nice too around the fires of camp. His voice, and playing, too, damages our enemies. In time,
I fear though, that they may harm us as well....<br>
<br>
<br>
Quadro. Fierce. Skilled. Adept. These are all words I would use to describe the team's leader,
Quadro. His magic and fighting prowess have proven valuable on more than one occasion. both in and out of combat. Many of the mystical items the party
possesses are thanks to his own hand. He does posses one fatal flaw, however. His lack of focus, which often leads to chaotic
decisions. Perhaps this is why his orders are oft questioned by the others. But overall, the team we have become-who we are as a whole- is due in great part to his guidance and determination. Were he truly to focus, to gain an understanding of the enlightenment I possess, he would become one of the most
formidable individuals I have ever known. it seems, that sometimes, the best way to lead is not to lead at all...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Entry II</b><br>
<br>
Today, our band claimed a great victory for their world. A leader of their realm who had
disappeared was slain, for the better. During his absence, he had been transformed
into one of the unnatural. Our time was short when we learned of his presence within the Temple of Air. It was by the words of a repentant priest that we discovered his whereabouts. We were low on
resources, having encountered resistance, much more so than the first time we assaulted the temple. Instead of large,
electric arrowhawks, we fought smaller ones. But this time, they were not alone. Lions,
fiendish creatures, accompanied them, as well as a lizardine spellcaster, and a squad of ogres. Luckily, we were able to defeat these without too much blood loss on our parts. It reminded me of a rrakkma. Would that our enemies had been the accursed flayers. Many times
I have seen them, and many times I had fought. I find it strange that, having reached a new level of enlightenment, I was to manifest the same mental blast that they use. The effect was the same as it is on the unwillful. A single manifest was sufficient to paralyze many of the ogres, likely choices for the effect, due to
their renowned lack of will. We dispersed our enemies with our usual skill. The lions
were surprisingly easy to defeat, and the rest fell quickly to spells and steel. Afterward, the female Mewn and
I scouted ahead, wary of new dangers. We found that we had been watched since the moment we entered the temple, by a high priest, who had recently given up his ways of evil. He had been scrying with his ball of crystal, and even saw the invisible Mewn. The party soon joined us, and we were given information. Oft times, this is more powerful than the gold. We were told the location of the Prince Throm-el. His vampiric form was resting in a different section of the temple, and we were given instructions on how to get to him, and how to reveal his coffin. We didn't listen to his advice about the trap just before his chamber. Of course, it went off. Luckily, it was dark tentacles, which we dispersed without too much problem. With low resources, and little
preparation, we advanced upon the chamber of the undead prince. Due to my great speed, I was the chosen to go and flip the switch needed to reveal his coffin, buried several feet below the surface. The switch was flipped, and the ground slid open. The room went silent, some spell
I'd wager. Luckily, our wands were useful, as were spells cast beyond the boundaries
of the doorway. it was this fact that lead to our victory. The creature emerged from his coffin, and the battle began. We fought
valiantly. Mewn fell victim to his charm, and attacked Nu'mnar. Luckily, Julen was there to interfere with her attacks.  His coffin was shattered by my mental attack, cutting off his escape. We had him. Quadro dived into the pit, and I followed, fighting from the walls. He rose from the crevasse, and began to assault those above. Spells were useless inside the area of silence. Quadro had borrowed my ring of altitude. Even the potent item would not let him leap from the pit, however. His plight caught my eye, and I was faced with a choice. Should
I strike at the fiend while he was occupied, or should I get Quadro out of the pit.. The choice wasn't even one.
I dove into the pit, and rescued our leader, moving him to the safety of the doorway. With a few eldritch words, spell energies flowed through the silence, striking the vampire. he struggled for a moment, but, to everyone's surprise and amazement, changed form into a small fish. We all knew we had little time, and struck quickly, doing as much damage to the fish as we could. Almost immediately, he reformed, into a mist, and sought to escape. His coffin destroyed, he had no choice but to flee into the walls. this was futile, as the guile and skill of our group once again prevailed. His path was blocked by flashing steel. A few sword strokes more, and the form solidified, into the destroyed form of the prince. We had won. A cry of joy, triumph, would have been heard, had the silence not persisted. Now, We must find a way to bring the good man the prince was back to life once more.....<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Entry III</b><br>
<br>
The prince has been restored. Once again, we made a pilgrimage to the Seven Heavens, and brought the long-lost prince back to the land of the living. We were then faced with a problem, which was made a blessing for me. the spell we were to use to travel back to the Prime world was not powerful enough to take us all. One would be left behind. I
volunteered. I felt by this time, I had gained sufficient personal power to return to my home, and take my place among the Cenobites. I bid my compatriots farewell, and headed for the portal to Sigil.</p>
<p align="left">It was no trouble to transverse the streets of Sigil. I replaced the ring of Altitude
I had given Quadro, and made my way through the market ward. The item I was looking for was not to be found, but the
proprietor of the Friendly Fiend assured me he could get me what I was looking for. I told him I would return for it soon, in no more than a month in the future. I hoped it would bring ease to the world of my friends.</p>
<p align="left">With my order placed, I made my way to the Hive ward. Therein lies a portal back to my home plane of Limbo.  I had best hurry, for the night draws near. And only a clueless would be caught outside in the hive after dark. Thankfully,
I had enough time to make my way into the Bottle and Jug.  As usual for this time of day, there was a fight going on in the arena. I bought a ticket to watch. I found long ago that it was best to prepare for the chaos of Limbo, and a fight here is filled with Chaos. I took my seat, and waited for the evening's challengers to begin. I had always fancied the chance to fight Arka. It would be a good test of my personal strength and devotion. I was
receiving some odd looks. Many times I had forgotten the form I was in.  It was rare to find a creature of good here in this powers-forsaken place.
I tried to remain inconspicuous. A thought occurred to me while I was watching the poor sods fight the one-eyed brute.
I decided to stay in the Cage one more day, to do some research.</p>
<p align="left">The morning came quickly. Thankfully, my gear was intact when I woke, no doubt due to the fact that
I was "a guardinal" I made my way to the Hall of Records to do some research. Just as
I had suspected. I paid for a small scroll, and hurried on my way. I returned to the hive, and removed the dice I had taken from the temple. I held them aloft at the doorway to Maris P'tran's butcher shop, and the portal to the great chaos of Limbo opened up.  I steeled my will against the swirling mass, and stepped through.</p>
<p align="left">The plane had changed since last I left it. Ha. As if the plane did anything BUT change. With a steady determination,
I headed for the great monastery of Zerth Ad'Lun. It was easy to find, though the distance was great. One quality about Limbo...a place you know is closer than those you don't. A few hours into the chaos, and
I arrived at the monastery. I encountered a group of Slaadi along my travels, though they were uninterested in me. One, named Xorexet did pause for a moment to speak with me. Odd. For a slaadi, he seemed
almost. focused. We spoke briefly, of nothing of import. I have found through past dealings that this is the best way to deal with them, keep
their minds moving between subjects, and off of fighting.  Perhaps our paths will cross again.</p>
<p align="left">Upon my arrival on the small area occupied by the stability of the
monastery, I paused to meditate, staring into the chaos, and trying to focus past it. I was able to form a small, stable sphere of rock that attached itself to the land mass beneath the temple. I was now ready for my testing. I checked my gear again, and headed inside.</p>
<p align="left">They were waiting for me. My appearance took them by surprise. All but my sensei. He knew me from the moment
I arrived, and demanded an explanation for my form. We discussed matters of the prime over a soft tea, which a recent trading group had brought back from the city of Half folk, Barnstable. I was not reprimanded for abandoning my natural state, but was told to make a special trip to Elysium to ask the permission of the Lupinals to use the form of one of
their kind. I readily agreed, and he informed me that it was time to begin my training.</p>
<p align="left">I was lead into the great Hall of Zerth-A'bol. There, the few who had made Cenobite status were there, all heads bowed when my master and
I entered. I was taken to the central circle, and the testing began. For hours upon end
I was questioned as to the nature of chaos, of order, and of personal power. I was tested on my insight, having to fight several of my brothers in complete darkness. I was allowed to do nothing but protect myself. Luckily, it was what
I was best at. if I struck out at one of the others, I would have failed automatically.
I knew this. I was unsure how, but I just...knew. Perhaps it was part of the training. Perhaps it was the lesson
I was supposed to learn. I held my own for as long as I could, taking what few blows landed, and managing to resist the rest. But, eventually, my inner strength failed me, and
I fell.</p>
<p align="left">I awoke to find myself still in the central circle, surrounded by my peers and superiors. I slowly pulled myself to standing, and resumed my defensive stance. I was ready for
their assault once more, but, as my feet found the floor once again, all heads in the room bowed, and they pulled back, resuming
their places they had been in when I arrived. I was approached by my master, and asked if
I felt I was ready for further enlightenment. Seeing as I had failed to stand under the attacks of my fellows,
I had to say that I was not. My master nodded, and turned his back to me. I did not move.
I stood there, unsure as to whether I should leave, or continue to stay. While trying to decide,
I failed to notice the strike my master had thrown at me. At the last possible moment,
I pushed his hand aside, and without thinking, I lashed out at him. My fist connected a solid blow, and my master pulled back. He stood, as if nothing had happened, and bowed to me. "You, Zerth Nox , are now ready. Go forth into the Prime. Aid those whom you travel with. Find your guidance within. Your true test shall come to you soon. You realize the importance of it."</p>
<p align="left">I nodded, and bowed to each of those present. I was told to meditate for three days on the lessons I had learned that day.</p>
<p align="left">The time passed quickly, and soon it was time for me to depart. many times during my stay did
I think back to those friends I had left on the prime, and wondered of their fate. My brother Cenobite, Merid K'alusit took me to the edge of the stability, and shifted us both to the Prime world
I had spent so much time on as of late. I then set out on the journey to find my compatriots. I bid Merid farewell, and headed into the city. there,
I wait.<br>

Entry IV<br>
</b>
<br>
My mind is again filled with the roiling chaos of Limbo. How I came to be here is still unclear to me, but
I do know one thing for certain. I have achieved a new level of insight this day. We were fighting a Sphere of Many eyes. My mind wanders back to the exact moment of the battle. We were unsure of our chances. I dare say that
I was fearful of the outcome as well. This is why I put myself into danger.</p>
<p align="left">I knew that, should the large eye focus on me, that my best chance would be to defend. I therefore moved myself into a position to draw the fire from the beast. The battle was surprisingly quick. We had luck on our side. Rask called forth a
column of flames from the heavens, Mewn sent a charge of electricity from a wand through the creature. My attack on the creature's mind failed. It then focused three of the smaller, ray-bearing eyes upon me, and fired. I was not sure of the effects, but, was thankful that
I dodged them. I was particularly thankful for my training this day. With the Fist of Zerth in hand, I moved in to attack. The beast had moved by this time, and I was able to strike from behind. I brought back the mighty weapon, and just as I was about to strike, the lesson my master had taught me made itself known. A moment before the sword was swung,
I had a flash of insight. I knew that had I swung as I intended, the creature would escape unharmed.
I adjusted my angle, and swung, dealing a massive wound to the evil sphere. While the beast still writhed from my attack, Meepo emerged from the wall, and struck the beast down with a ball of fire. The day had been won.<br>
<br>
The next battle was less victorious for us. I pray my companions are alright. We were fighting several giants of stone. the battle was taken in our usual fashion. I defended, and the others picked off whoever was most threatening. In this case, it was the giant with fire in his eyes, and a fiendish look about him.  the battle went well,
until one of the giants pushed me back. Weakness. I shall make sure that does not happen again. The giants invaded the room where we fought, and we fought harder. then, something happened.
I say something, because I am not exactly sure of what it was. One moment, I was surrounded by giants and my friends...the next, I met the roiling primordial Limbo once more. Luckily, I was able to find my way quickly, and am now back at the
monastery. I hope to return to assist my friends soon.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow, after resting, I shall travel to Sigil, the city of doors. There, I shall sell the spoils we have collected, and obtain supplies that will no doubt be useful in our travels. Primary among these are scrolls which will allow teleportation, and a Mancatcher used to halt such things. I remember back...<br>
<br>
It was on my first excursion to Sigil. My master had taken me there to show me the inhabitants, and several of the other planes, albeit briefly. I do not remember my age. What
I do remember is a befuddled old wizard, leading something down the streets of what
I now know to be the lower ward. The great metal contraption was held aloft by what
I could only assume was a spell of levitation. it was from this device that I learned the attack
I now use to cause opponents to pause. The device hung limply in the air, and I asked my master what it was. He replied that it was an Apparatus of Kawalsh, a device used to traverse the depths of the oceans. I eyed it with curiosity. Why does it look like that,
I asked. He explained to me that it took the form of a prime creature called a lobster, and that the shape allowed it to move through the waters more easily. he pointed out that there were a few appendages missing, and deduced that the wizard was here to have it repaired. It was just then that
I noticed a small child moving close to it. Whether others had noticed him or not,
I wasn't sure. I watched him climb up, and into the Apparatus. Apparently, it was controlled from within. Whatever the child had done had spectacular effect, and the "creature" began to flail about wildly. Several guards cam over to see the commotion, only to be struck down by the thrashing legs and claws.
I watched, amazed, as this..flying thing took down several strong men, before one managed to get inside and remove the offending child.  My master suggested we move on, but the guards had other ideas. they wished to ask us about the incident. My master said we had no time, and prepared to shift us to another part of the city. it was then that
I felt the jaws of something around my waist, and as I watched my mater vanish, I
wondered why I was not gone as well. the men had not seen the incident, and the child had run off after. They assumed then, that
I was the one responsible. I pleaded with them, saying that I was not the one they wanted. A few moments later, my master returned, and after a few harsh words, struck out at the men who held me. The fight was over quickly, and the "mancatcher" clattered to the ground. it was then that my master and I departed.<br>
<br>
Upon our return to the monastery, I practiced the motions made by the levitating
device. It took me many months, but I finally managed to emulate them somewhat. it is then that I chose to show my master what
I had been training to do. He seemed pleased, and asked me to name the new maneuver. I was so young then. I told him that the name of the move was the Flying Lame Lobster Kick. that name haunts me still. it has been the attack I use to stun my opponents, if not in deed, in name alone. I get teased by my brothers about it to this day. But,
I have learned to wear the ridicule as a symbol of pride, for my stunning attack is unlike any of those in my order. and
I learned a lesson. name your moves well. </p>

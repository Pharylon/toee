      <p>We're baaaaaaaaack!</p>
      <p>Coming this winter, the reunion spectactular!</p>
      <!-- <p>So, the plan is to do a reunion spectactular this winter. I want to lay out a few thoughts on this and get some feedback.
        And I really want the feedback! Something I've come to realize over the last decade or so is that the DM isn't a god
        who sits on high. This isn't <em>my</em> game, this is <em>our</em> game. And in that vein, these are my current
        thoughts on the reunion, and I want to hear feedback from everyone. Don't take any of this as gospel or set in stone. If 
        something I say here rubs you the wrong way, let me know! I welcome criticism and contrariness here. ðŸ˜Š
      </p>
      <p>
          I'm thinking everyone just set their level to 15. I think the highest level people were 14 when the 
          campaign ended, so we'll do 15 for everyone. Then go into the books and find some magic items you like. I'm thinking
          we be generous with the gold for this, maybe items as if you were 17th level? Especially if you're picking items that
          are cool, not just boring stat bonus stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as time that has passed, I'm leaning towards 20 years. I haven't seen anyone veto that. Speak within the next week or 
        hold your peace if you want a different amount of time to have elapsed. Jerod, Alan, and Ray, y'all had the humans so
        it'll affect you the most and your votes count for more. I want this nailed down soonish because I want people to start
        being able to throw out ideas and work with others about what they've been up to since then.

    <div>I've updated <a href="./numenarhJournal/numenarhs_journal.html">Numenarh's Journal</a>
      with a bunch of new entries.&nbsp; If you've never read through his journal before, now's a good time to start.&nbsp; Well,
      as good a time as any. ;)&nbsp; Seriously, it's a pretty good read. </div>

    <h2>December 3, 2002</h2>
    <div>
      <p>New character sheets for <a href="Mewn.htm">Mewn</a>, <a href="Julin.htm">Julin</a>,
        <a href="Meepo.htm">Meepo</a>, and <a href="drak.htm"> Drak</a> are up, as well as <a href="pcgen.htm"> PCGen files</a>
        for them that are current with version 4.2.0.&nbsp; I still need Nox's character sheet to get his up, and Scott said he was
        going to do Quadro, so Scott, email me the file when you get it done. </p>

  <div class="news">
    <h2>December 3, 2002</h2>
    <div>
      <p>OK, my PCGen files are now fixed.&nbsp; I'm very pleased to say that I got bonus spell progression working in the
        Monte Cook bard (which, as Jerod can tell you, has <i>never</i> worked).&nbsp; Anyway, you can download my new PCGen
        data files <a href="http://bellsouthpwp.net/z/s/zshuford/zachs.zip">here</a>.&nbsp; As we speak, I'm working on getting
        the rest of the characters up on the site.&nbsp; More later today. </p>

      <p>Don't download my PCGen files, as I've discovered a couple problems with them.&nbsp; I should have a new version
        up tomorrow. </p>
      <p>In the mean time, I <i>have </i>managed to get a new version of Numenarh up on the site.&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; Everyone
        else I have should get up tomorrow.&nbsp; Jayson, I don't have your character sheet, so you'll need to email it to
        me or something.&nbsp; I don't think any of the files you'd use to create Nox have any problems, so you can
        <a href="http://bellsouthpwp.net/z/s/zshuford/zachs.zip">download</a>
        the lst files and have at it.&nbsp; But make sure you have the new 4.2.0 version of <a href="http://pcgen.sourceforge.net">PCGen</a>,

    <div>
      <p>After another long break from updating the site, we're back in business. </p>
      <p><a href="mewns_journal.htm">Mewn's Journal</a> has been updated with a new entry. </p>
      <p><a href="./numenarhJournal/numenarhs_journal.html">Numenarh's Journal</a> has been updated with no less than two
        new entries.&nbsp; Additionally, a <a href="letter_to_num.htm">Letter to Numenarh</a> has also been added as some
        extra credit Matt did that wasn't' a journal entry. </p>
      <p>And Nox now has a journal as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first four entries of <a href="noxs_journal.htm">The Progressive
          Journal of Zerth Nox</a>
        are all now online. </p>
      <p>I have updated <a href="http://bellsouthpwp.net/z/s/zshuford/zachs.zip">my PCGen data files</a> to work with the
        newest version of PCGen.&nbsp; I'd like everyone to download it and use the newer versions instead of the old 2.7.3
        so that we're all on the same proverbial page. The new PCGen is faster, and will very soon be supporting stuff like
        d20 Modern that I know we all want. :)&nbsp; To use my data files, download and install PCGen as normal (the download
        site is <a href="http://pcgen.sourceforge.net">here</a>), and then download and unzip my file.&nbsp; You should see
        a folder called &quot;data.&quot;&nbsp; You need this folder <i>in addition to</i> the data folder that comes with
        the PCGen download.&nbsp; You need them both.&nbsp; Drop both data folders into the main PCGen folder. When you put
        the second one in, it'll ask you if you're sure you want to move it, that there is already a folder called data and
        that files with the same name will be overwritten.&nbsp; Say &quot;yes to all.&quot;&nbsp; And presto, you're in
        good shape. </p>
      <p>Lastly, I've officially launched my Planescape site, <a href="http://www.zachshuford.com/kriegstanz/">The Kriegstanz
        </a>, today.&nbsp; I've put a god-awful ton of work into it, and I'm very happy with the outcome.&nbsp; I've received
        over one thousand hits today, so I'm considering it a success.&nbsp; Those are pretty good first day numbers, if
        I do say so myself. :)&nbsp; Anyway, I'd love to hear what y'all think about it, so drop by and check it out if you
        have the time. </p>

      <p><a href="./numenarhJournal/numenarhs_journal.html">Numenarh's Journal</a> is now also up to date with his newest

      <p>Ahem. </p>

      <p><a href="rasks_journal.htm">Rask's Journal</a> now has a new entry.&nbsp; You may faint now. </p>

    <h2>July 27, 2002</h2>

    <div>
      <p>Madre de Dios!&nbsp; Two updates in as many weeks?&nbsp; Is it possible?&nbsp; Yes, it is! </p>

      <p> XP totals are new, and those are just what Scott sent out.&nbsp; I still haven't finished double-checking it, since
        the older mail doesn't include a list of creatures, and so will require me to delve into the distant past to verify
        it.&nbsp; But it should do for now, and is <i>probably</i>
        correct (and if wrong, only off by a bit). </p>

      <p>Second, Numenarh's Journal has now been updated with entry eleven, though I appear to be missing ten.&nbsp; Um,
        Matt, could you resend that one to me.&nbsp; :) </p>

      <p>Third, There is *gasp* a new Letter to Jenna!&nbsp; Next thing you know, Julin's Epic will be updated.&nbsp; ;)
        </p>

      <p>Fourth, the beta version of the Dwarven Battle Mage is finally up on the site.&nbsp; :D </p>

      <p>Also, I want everyone to send me the newest version of their characters (the pcg file from PCGen) so I can get those
        up-to-date too. </p>

  <div class="news">
    <h2>June 5, 2002</h2>

    <div>
      <p>A couple updates today. </p>

      <p>First, the <a href="dervish.htm">Whirling Dervish</a> public beta has been approved for 1.0 and has gone gold master.&nbsp;
        (i.e. I'm approving it for play). </p>

      <p>Second, <a href="xp.htm">XP</a> has been corrected.&nbsp; I left some stuff out before.&nbsp; :( </p>

      <p>Third, in case you didn't get the email, <a href="mewns_journal.htm">Mewn's journal</a> has been updated.
      </p>

      <p>Fourth, you can now read a pretty detailed description of Oerth's history, people, and languages in my new extra,
        <a href="oerth.htm">Oerth's History</a>.&nbsp; It took me many hours to compile this, so read it, dammit.&nbsp; ;)
        </p>

      <p>Fifth, you can now <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/zshuford/.cv/zshuford/Public/10,000%20Maniacs%20-%20Because.mp3-link.mp3">download
          a copy</a> of Because the Nights by 10,000 Maniacs from my website, just because they rock out.&nbsp; And anyone
        that says otherwise gets an XP penalty next adventure.&nbsp; :D </p>
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class="news">
    <h2>May 29, 2002</h2>
    <div>
      <p> Minor updates today.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

      <p> First, I fixed a couple errors with Numenarh's <a href="Numenarh.htm">character sheet</a> and <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/zshuford/.cv/zshuford/Public/pcgen/Numenarh.pcg-link.pcg">PCGen
          file
        </a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

      <p> Second, I added <a href="Lance.htm">Lance</a> to the site.&nbsp; Alan, I've advanced him to 4th "level" as an animal,
        and I went ahead and assigned his skill points, but feel free to change them.&nbsp; Also, his HP are wrong because
        I don't know what they used to be, and you'll need to roll them for his current level anyway.&nbsp; To make changes,
        download his
        <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/zshuford/.cv/zshuford/Public/pcgen/Lance.pcg-link.pcg">PCGen file
        </a>, make alterations, and then mail it back to me, and I'll put the updated version on the site. </p>

      <p> Thirdly, I added and updated version of Quadro's <a href="Quadro.htm">character sheet</a> and <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/zshuford/.cv/zshuford/Public/pcgen/Quadro.pcg-link.pcg">PCGen
          file
        </a>. </p>

      <p> Lastly, I tweaked XP totals to reflect XP spent on item creation last adventure (thanks for reminding me, Matt).
        </p>
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class="news">
    <h2>May 28, 2002</h2>
    <div>
      <p>I'm on the ball today.&nbsp; Lots of updates. </p>

      <p>First off, I've corrected an error in my <a href="homepage.mac.com/zshuford/.cv/zshuford/Public/pcgen/zachs.zip-link.zip">PCGen
          data files</a> that was keeping the Ranger and Bard from picking up new spells.&nbsp; In addition, I've added Alan's
        spell, Entangling Ball, so you'll need to download a new copy if you want any of that. Oh, and I fixed the Ranger's
        favored enemy so that it shows the actual&nbsp; humanoid type (i.e. "goblin" or "orc") instead of just the word "Humanoid
        Type."&nbsp; Unfortunately, old Ranger characters (i.e. Numenarh) will probably not work anymore, and if they do
        they'll have errors.&nbsp; But I went ahead and redid Numenarh, so Matt, you can download a new PCGen file for him
        right <a href="homepage.mac.com/zshuford/.cv/zshuford/Public/pcgen/Numenarh.pcg-link.pcg">here</a>.&nbsp; You might
        need to double check to make sure I didn't get anything wrong, but I don't think I did.&nbsp; Oddly enough, though,
        after putting skill ranks into everything you already had ranks in, I ended up with a few extra skill points.&nbsp;
        I manually added them up and everything, and you definitely have four skill points unspent, so I guess that works
        out pretty good for you. ;)&nbsp;&nbsp; I've also got PCGen files for <a href="homepage.mac.com/zshuford/.cv/zshuford/Public/pcgen/Julin.pcg-link.pcg">Julin</a>
        and <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/zshuford/.cv/zshuford/Public/pcgen/Tyro.pcg-link.pcg">Tyro</a>
        up, should anyone need them. Everyone else, I'd like you to send me the PCGen file you're using for your character so I can
        have a copy. </p>

      <p>Secondly, there is a new entry for <a href="./numenarhJournal/numenarhs_journal.html">Numenarh's Journal</a> up.
        </p>

      <p>Thirdly, though it'd be <i>way</i> too much work for me to keep up with everyone's monetary amounts, as of now I
        want everyone to start sending me an email stating how much money they have after every adventure.&nbsp; I'm doing
        this because (A) it discourages cheating (not that I think anyone is, but still) and (B) so that if anyone looses
        their character sheet (like I lost Jerod's - heh) we'll know at least roughly how much cash they had. </p>

      <p> Fourthly, new <a href="xp.htm">XP</a> is up.&nbsp; Just to save me the trouble of changing it later, I assumed
        that Russ and Matt would do extra credit, and went ahead and calculated it in.&nbsp; See, I told you I'd start do
        this more timely.&nbsp; :D </p>

      <p> Fifthly, there are new character sheets are up for <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/d20/zach/Tyro.htm">Tyro</a>,
        <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/d20/zach/Julin.htm">Julin</a>, and <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/d20/zach/Numenarh.htm">Numenarh</a>.&nbsp;
        Others will be up as I receive the PCGen files. </p>

      <p>Sixthly, and most seriously, I have had complaints from a number of people that someone, and I won't say who, is
        cheating on dice rolls.&nbsp; Therefore, I'm afraid I'm going to have to implement a new rule.&nbsp; Whenever you
        roll your dice, you must leave the dice sitting on the table until someone else looks over and double checks the
        results.&nbsp; If you don't, you'll have to reroll.&nbsp; I'm sorry that I have to do this, but if someone is cheating,
        I guess this is the only course of action to take. </p>

    </div>

  <div class="news">
    <h2>May 10, 2002</h2>
    <div>
      <p> New <a href="file:///C:/WINDOWS/Desktop/Web/xp.htm">Experience</a>

      <p> And in case you didn't already know, Mewn's Journal is also (relatively) new. </p>

  <div class="news">
    <h2>April 25, 2002</h2>
    <div>
      <p>New updates again today. </p>

      <p>First, I've corrected character <a href="xp.htm">XP</a>.&nbsp; Hopefully, its all good now.&nbsp; The addition of
        the Owbear was just enough to bring Rask up to the next level. </p>

      <p>Second, I've added the Alpha versions of the Battlemage and the Whirling Dervish to the site.&nbsp; I'd love to
        hear what everyone thinks about them balance and flavor-wise. </p>

  <div class="news">
      <h2>April 23, 2002</h2>
      <div>
          <p>A few updates today.&nbsp; First, and announcement.&nbsp; As of now, there will be no longer be any back extra credit
              allowed.&nbsp; The reasons are many and complex, and I've discussed it with several members of the group, so I won't
              repeat them here.&nbsp; If you want to talk to me about it, feel free to email me. </p>
        
            <p>Second, Numenarh's Journal has been updated.&nbsp; As usual, it's a good read and I want to again thank Matt and Russ
              for submitting new entries week after week.&nbsp; Thanks, guys.&nbsp; </p>

  <p><b>April 17, 2002</b> </p>

    <p>The site updates heavily again.&nbsp; And life is good. </p>

    <p>First, what everyone's been waiting for, new <a href="xp.htm">XP</a>
      has been assigned.&nbsp; No one gained a level.&nbsp; Heh.&nbsp; Just kidding.&nbsp; ;) </p>

    <p>Second, Quadro's first <a href="letterstojenna.htm">Letter to Jenna</a>
      is up.&nbsp; It's defiantly worth a read. </p>

    <p>Third, <a href="http://www.aardvarkarchie.com/pictures/images/animals/animals022.jpg">Monkeys are funny</a>.&nbsp;
      They just are. </p>

    <p>Fourth, in case you didn't know, <a href="mewns_journal.htm">Mewn's journal
      </a> was updated yesterday. </p>


  </div>

  <p><b>April 10, 2002</b> </p>

  <div>
    <p>First, the long awaited first installment of <a href="rasks_journal.htm">Rask's Journal</a> is now up. </p>

    <p>Second, updated versions of Julin and Grawl are up. </p>

    <p>Third, the XP Totals have been updated.&nbsp; Also, I've added a link to the sidebar that will, in the future, house
      the current XP totals of all the characters and&nbsp;even give a breakdown of XP earned over your adventures.
    </p>

    <p>Everyone got 982 XP for last adventure.&nbsp; Numenarh and Mewn and Rask get bonus XP for the extra credit they turned
      in.&nbsp; Numenarh catches up the Mewn due to Matt's extra credit on the Unbringer.&nbsp; The new totals are: </p>

  <p><b>April 7, 2002</b> </p>

  <div>
    <p>Minor fixes to the site all around.&nbsp; Will get to some serious updating tomorrow. </p>
  </div>

  <p><b>March 25, 2002</b> </p>

  <div>
    <p>Lots of updates today.&nbsp; First, <a href="./numenarhJournal/numenarhs_journal.html">Numenarh's Journal
      </a> has been updated.&nbsp; Second, you can see <a href="raskprophecy.htm"> Rask's Prophecy</a>, one of the main bases
      for his character history (where's that journal you keep promising me, Ray?).&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Third, you can now look
      at the alpha version of the
      <a href="file:///C:/WINDOWS/Desktop/Web/unbringer.htm">Unbringer</a>.&nbsp; Any feedback on it would be most appreciated
      by Matt, Ray, and I.&nbsp; And last, a minor organizational change worth noting: with the addition of Rask's Prophecy
      and the prestige class, I no longer had room on the menu above to include them all, so all non-journal extras have
      been moved to a separate page that you can access by clicking the "more" option on the header frame. </p>
  </div>
  </div>



  <p><b>March 22, 2002</b> </p>

  <div>
    <p>Its Double Mewn Day.&nbsp; <a href="mewns_journal.htm">Mewn's Journal</a>
      has been updated, plus her character portrait now appears on <a href="Mewn.htm">her character sheet</a>.&nbsp; (Remember,
      to see the full portrait, you need to select one of the expanded page number options). </p>
  </div>
  </div>



  <p><b>March 20, 2002</b> </p>

  <div>
    <p>The ever-elusive character sheet for <a href="Tyro.htm">Tyro</a> has finally been added.&nbsp; Also, Numenarh's age
      has been fixed after having mysteriously aged. </p>
  </div>
  </div>



  <p><b>March 18, 2002</b> </p>

  <div>
    <p>The first parts of <a href="epic.htm">The Exploits of Julin Sander, et al and the Third Rise of the Temple of Elemental
        Evil
      </a> is now up.&nbsp; It's real good stuff.&nbsp; Also <a href="./numenarhJournal/numenarhs_journal.html">Numenarh's
        Journal
      </a> has been updated as well, and it is of course good as well. :)&nbsp; </p>

    <p><a href="Mewn.htm">Mewn</a> and <a href="Quadro.htm">Quadro's</a> character sheets are now updated to their current
      levels, though Quadro's is a bit outdated (Scott, you need to send me the current version - I know you have it!).&nbsp;
      Tyro still isn't updated.&nbsp; Tomorrow.&nbsp; I promise.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Lastly, a lot of updates in the <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/WebObjects/FileSharing.woa/3/wo/I55rVmm7TCzltpoG.1/0.2.1.2.27.31.97.0.35.0.0.1.1.1?user=zshuford&amp;fpath=pcg%20Files&amp;templatefn=FileSharing.htmlr=zshuford&amp;fpath=pcg%20Files&amp;templatefn=FileSharing.html">PCGen
        files
      </a>.&nbsp; All of the characters (save Tyro and Julin) are now updated, so you can download them and gaze upon them
      in PCGen.&nbsp; Also, the PCGen data files are updated.&nbsp; Remember, you need to download these and add them to
      PCGen to use my custom campaign stuff (such as the new ranger class). </p>

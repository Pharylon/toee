<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">Seeing
you again for just the second time makes me feel like we’ve always known each
other, for your eternal beauty refreshes my soul as that of cold stream water to
parched lips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I sincerely do
understand that in your current profession, that you have no time for love.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I also understand that the gentlemen and the scalliwags that you
administer to care not one copper piece for your emotional affections or to
return them.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">I
make no bones about my deep feelings for you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The first time we were together, I felt a certain closeness with you that
was never there for any of the other women I had past bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although you happen to be human makes not a bone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You have a serene eminence about you that pervades your movement and
verbiage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I suppose I alone have
noticed it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am the lucky one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You my dear, though unbeknownst to you at the time, are just as, if not
more lucky. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">My
last encounter with you was frustrating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wholly
in part to the fact that you see me as an obsessed adventurer smitten with your
wares.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Untrue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I care nothing of your wares…well what I mean to say is, I like you for
you, and not what you have physically given me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Maybe on the outside you see me as just another scruffy rogue wanderer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Let me tell you a little about the Quadro Gemini that you may not know.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">I
was born Targin Gemana 60 years ago in the foothills of the Yatil Mountains, 15
miles south of a town called Krestible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
Mother Callisene and my father Raff raised 18 children, one male and the rest
female.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My parents were very
attentive and doting of their only son, and instilled early on the virtue of
good over evil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My father, a
barbarian from the local Kraka Clan, encouraged me to become a fierce Warrior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He would take me to the surface to hunt and practice fighting skills as
early as eight years of age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
at such an early time period my father said that I was a quick learner, a
prodigious student if you will.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
one time felled a brown bear with my bare hands at the age of 23.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I fought hard, but back underground, I studied even harder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My mother was always secretly supportive of my book knowledge and the
desire to learn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was around this
time that she would tell me stories of Human and Elven wizards that wielded the
mysterious mental powers of Magic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
yearned to discover all I could learn about this ‘magic’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>On solo hunting excursions on the surface I would trek to Krestible to
learn more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wondrous Lore was a
magic shoppe on the outskirts of town run by a lady named Circe Orion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Forced to a locale on the outskirts of town due to bigger and better
shoppes elsewhere, Circe still had plenty of tomes for an eager mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She imparted me a few books on apprenticeship and bid me farewell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hurrying back to the caves in the hills I had all but made up my mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Magic was much more to me than just a passing fancy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was a yearning, a destiny of sorts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I would pack my things and leave home that night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My fighting skills though not honed to perfection would help me in the
quest to find a skilled wizard that would take me on as an apprentice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Though, the decision had been made for me by the time I had arrived home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My father had ransacked my quarters only to find the books on Magic I had
been reading.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Utterly furious with
me, he banished me from his home for five years.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">To
this day it’s been thirty-seven years since I’ve been back.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">I
went back to see Circe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She let me
stay in the back of the shoppe for free for awhile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Almost two years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
too busy to take me on as a study, but I sure did read a lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She talked about a wizard that was taking apprentices.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">His
moniker was Bartok the Noble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
was actually a priest who knew a fine bit about the arcane arts as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She said that I could find him south in the land of Veluna though she did
not know exactly where.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It was my goal to find him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Through a 12-year ordeal of trial and turmoil of which I care not to
discuss at present, I finally found Bartok in a city called Mitrik.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bartok was not taking apprentices anymore by this time, but found
something interesting enough in me to invite me to stay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bartok was a gray-haired Human, somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 or 60
years old.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He was sharp although frail looking. Perhaps it was my
stature that caused him to consider it, to take me on as a bodyguard of sorts,
hell I don’t know.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">All
I know is from that moment on….things were not that great.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Bartok made me sign an agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A contract to fifteen years of indentured servitude, and in
return, he would teach me the arts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well,
I thought, fifteen years isn’t so bad for a Dwarf, but will he live that long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As it turns out…almost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First
thing Bartok did, was change my name. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>If
I was going to be a wizards apprentice, I had to fully change my birth name and
alter my surname to something more ‘regally upbeat’ is how he put it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He gave me the name Quadro.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was an odd sounding name, but he said that it was derived from the
four elements that I as a mage, would eventually draw power from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Gemini was my new last name, a small hop skip- and a jump from Gemana,
but it upset me that I was changing my family’s heritage to suit some
cantankerous old coot, but I told myself, it’s all or nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If I am gonna learn, I might as well put my head down and go with the
flow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So Quadro Gemini I was,
Housekeeper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At least that’s what
I believed my title to be for the better part of the first five years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Loyalty is what he said I should be demonstrating, and then we would
learn magic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was not allowed to
leave the house either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One of his
rules.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that true studies
need not be concerned with the outside world, only the boundaries of the mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Oft-times Bartok would be gone for 12 sometimes 14 hours of a day, only
to return weary and retire to his study for the eve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I did learn though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I pored
through old tomes and historical books in his library when he wasn’t home and
when I wasn’t cleaning up after his nasty ass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I learned a lot about the layout and the history of the Flanaess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I longed to journey out and explore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Over the course of the next few years, I got Bartok the Messy to teach me
all sorts of cantrips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was then
that he permitted me to venture out into the front or backyards to practice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Cantrips gone awry, he used to say, were recipes for a new house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I one time broke his mailbox with a flubbed prestidigitation spell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Over the next few years I had begun to master the cantrips he had given
me, and I yearned for bigger and better spells.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro, he would say, you must fully feel and be able to control the
energy that flows through you before we proceed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He said it destroyed many a mage before me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Gosh, I was so frustrated at how slow this was going.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">One
day in the year…oh it must have been about 581 cy, I was snooping through his
bed quarters and I stumbled upon a different sort of book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A diary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I nervously began
to read, all the while a knot had twisted up the bottom of my stomach that told
me repeatedly I shouldn’t be in here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
diary laid out Bartok’s life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well
for the hours he was gone in the day, Bartok was out attending something called
the College of Bishops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It also
revealed a password that I didn’t understand, the word was Azgharzak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I stood up and said it aloud.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
an eerie hiss, and the ringing of a bell, Bartok’s bookcase vanished and left
a descending stairway in its wake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fearing
Bartok would be home soon, I closed and replaced the diary and repeated the word
again to make the bookcase reappear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I tried to find a switch of some sort to close it, but no luck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I went back to the cellar hoping that it would close on it’s own, or
maybe that Bartok would think that he left it open.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Well night came and went, and Bartok didn’t say anything about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hmmm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I crept back into his
room to find the bookcase reappeared and everything as I had found it the
previous day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I dug out the diary
again to remember the word and repeated it once more to the same effect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Down the stairs was a chamber of sorts whereupon the floor was a giant
star inside a circle.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Black candles filled the chamber, some aglow, some snuffed
out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The walls were also covered in
books, but not on any shelf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
appeared to be held in place by entwining kudzu. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>How odd.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
started to realize that there was more to Bartok than I had imagined.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Over the last few seasons, he had grown more irritable and gruff with me
if not downright hostile at times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
place which reeked of evil and despair and a slight scent of Brimstone was
obviously his continual undoing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
read some of the tomes down there and learned that Azgharzak was the name of an
ancient Half-dragon Wizard turned demon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently
this was some sort of shrine to him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Over
the next year and a half, I fully mastered the cantrips I was shown and Bartok
was begrudgingly teaching me first level spells.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I finally had my own Spell book now, instead of writing everything down
on loose pieces of parchment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
usual I went outside to practice them and thankfully I did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although Bartok the Grumpy didn’t get too upset when I burned down his
fence with a not-quite-right shocking grasp spell.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">My
routine became ..well routine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyday
I had snuck into Bartok’s quarters<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>after
he left and would read his entry into his diary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was horrified at how dismally he viewed the world and people in
general.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Almost viscious in his
thoughts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My anger and bubbling
contempt for Bartok grew, but I said nothing for weeks and months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Until one day, he had eluded to a ritual that would inherently bring
Azgharzak forth from the outer planes and help him raze Mitrik and soon control
the whole continent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Almost
immediately, my bubbling contempt had transformed into seething anger and hatred
towards the man I had long considered my Mentor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I knew at once that Bartok must die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tonight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By my hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So soon as he slept that eve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
crept into his room with my dagger, and slit his throat ear to ear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Blood flowed over the edge of the bed pooling on the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The blood droplets made grotesque shadows on the wall of the candlelit
room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When it was over, I felt
nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not remorse, not relief,
just nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I let the dagger slip
from my hand and I followed it with my eyes as it tumbled in slow motion to the
floor where it stuck point first into the wood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Blood oozing down the blade to form a separate puddle around the knife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Murder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The word murder rang
over and over in my head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
realization hit me that I had just took another's life in cold blood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even though it was highly justified, it was still a crime punishable by
death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That night I packed up my
things and left town.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Over the next
few years I wandered from village to village along the banks of the Velverdyva
River.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">I
had realized since no one ever really knew who I was for the 14 years I had
stayed in Mitrik, I almost needn’t worry about getting caught.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I slowly began to feel a sense of Justice, especially as I looked into
the faces of the elderly shopkeepers in these villages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I knew they wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One day, not long ago, I entered a village called Oakhurst.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There was a lady inside offering a reward for the return of
some missing persons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I needed some
adventure in me and I went to sign up for the task.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It was there and then when I met most of the group I travel
with now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Numenarh Daerkwood, a
sly, softspoken yet powerful ranger whom I am teaching a bit about the arts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mewn Riverflow, an Elven rogue by design, I trust her no less than any
other party member.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She’s sweet
although a bit clumsy for a woman in her profession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A mighty cleric of St. Cuthbert named Rask the Destroyer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This guy can hang with the undead like the best of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One look at his holy symbol and bam….no skeletons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Julin Sandar, performer extrordinaire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He is a flamboyant fellow who likes to haggle with shopkeepers and sing
an uplifting tune to help us in battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
it weren’t for his penchant to start arguments, he’d be my favorite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The newcomers to our party are Grawl, a good gnoll and Tyro, a druid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have yet to learn much from them, but I will as the days go by.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Lucida Handwriting">So
you see, my sweet Jenna, I have a story, a background, a life.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I trust you wholly, and I want you to trust me with your
heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think about you when the
suns are up and in the dead of night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
wish the best for you and I will write again soon and let you know how we are

</span>Since I have last talked to you, we as a group have accomplished many
things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now this what I am about to
tell you is very secret/hush hush, so I would appreciate it if you didn’t go
running your lip about it, you know how you humans are, not to mention you
women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, we have invaded the
temple of the Elemental Evil cultists, and smashed some skulls.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I have since been alected leader of the party and am doing a
bang-up job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well, with the
exception that some people died.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some
more than once.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn had died,
three times and on a completely unrelated note, she wont let me touch her
breasts…go figure…anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our
beloved Meepo, Goblin Slayer has passed on once, as has our friend Tyro’s
first two wolves…I have a feeling there are going to be many more…shheeeesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>On top of all that, our cleric got changed into a Dwarf for some time, he
was looking kinda right if you know what I mean, just slap a dress on him
and……..well getting back to me story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
have been shot at, hacked up by some rogues, singed by fire and chilled by the
breath of an ogre mage, and still I think of you. I have learned a few new
skills that inhibit me from writing as much as I used to though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I currently make magical items for our group as well as magic weapons.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Not your run-of-the mill adventurer am I now?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I know you tried to brush me off during out last encounter, but I was
strong and I knew you needed time to get to know me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When I gave that letter to Sandy at the Inn before we left Verbobnc that
day, I knew that something was amiss between us, but I couldn’t put my finger
on it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And well with you having to deal with the death of
Jelanah, for that I am sorry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
there was anything that I could do, I would, but you know how humans are…dying
so quick and she was really old too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
mean really old, wasn’t she.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
she wasn’t, well she looked it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Anyway,
what I am trying to say…..hold on a sec, meepo is poking me with a
stick…..Be right back…………………………………………………<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Lucida Handwriting" size="2">……………………………..ok,
I am back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had to give the little
guy a noogie, but where was I?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oh
yeah, I just don’t think it’s going to work out between us….there, I said
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Don’t cry, I know you are
tore up inside, but there will be other men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I’m not doing it for anyone else, I don’t have a turtle dove in the
wings as so to speak, it’s just that, If I can’t see you, it’s wrong of me
to expect you to stay faithful, so I am cutting your string fair Jenna.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have enjoyed the time we spent together and I don’t regret the money
I had to spend to do it either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
will find someone else in due time, as well do not worry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I will make something for you in the near future and send it your way for
you to always think of me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Take
care of You now dear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>May Moradin
always smile on your enemies and smash them.<o:p>

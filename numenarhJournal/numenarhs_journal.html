		<h2>Entry One</h2>
		<p class="indented">I saw Mewn writing in her diary and when I asked her what she was doing she responded: "You should
			try it some time." So after some deliberation I have decided to write down some of what has been going on.</p>
		<p class="indented"> I was attempting to barter a ring from this woman at a jewelry shop when this small group came in.
			I did not know them at the time nor did I know I would be risking my life soon. Anyway I was trying to barter a ring to
			send home and when these people walk in the shopkeeper forgets me and talks to them instead. She mentions her son and
			others that are missing and that they went to The Sunless Citadel. Not a name of a place one would want to go being sunless
			and a citadel but apparently these fellows went and never came back. This woman offers money and goods to have the adventurers
			who walked in look for her son and his companions. These fellows agree quickly to help and then right away one of them
			turns to me and starts asking me questions, but first let me explain who these fellows are:</p>
		<p class="indented"> Julin started talking to me first. Julin is a flamboyant human who dresses in bright mismatching colors
			that yet seem to fit into his equally clashing personality. Julin apparently is a minstrel and I would learn later has
			a good voice for singing too.</p>
		<p class="indented"> The others that agreed to go to The Sunless Citadel for profit are Quadro, Barkin (they are both Dwarven)
			and Rask a worshiper of St. Cuthbert. Rask is human.</p>
		<p class="indented"> Julin asks if I know the area well and can I lead them to The Sunless Citadel. He wants to know if
			I am a Ranger. I respond by telling him: "I range." And so after some more conversation I agree to lead them to the citadel.
			Just before we leave---- for the citadel a second time having come back for rations and to heal Julin-----however we meet
			an Elven girl in a bar who is busy stealing, not so discreetly, money. For reasons I have yet to fathom Rask, the human
			Cleric, asks this Elven girl to come with us in order to stop her from being a thief. I opposed this addition to the group
			by saying: "No." 5 times but my words against including her were dismissed. So Mewn joined us but with the promise to
			repay the money she took. She could not simply return the money because the barkeep wanted her arrested so leaving it
			suspected but not confirmed by the Oakhurst authorities she stole the money was best.</p>
		<p class="indented"> .Later.after some traveling we reached the Citadel and made our way through it. During our explorations
			we discovered Kobolds and Goblins were at war inside the Citadel and we made an agreement, with Kobolds, to return a pet
			they had lost for a key we need to enter a room we found barred. Meepo, a Kobold also, was the keeper of this "pet.. The
			pet turned out to be a small white Dragon. Quadro and Rask promptly told Meepo he could not keep the dragon anymore..
			In fear of what his fellow Kobolds might do to him if he did not bring back the dragon little Meepo joined us. During
			the course of the numerous battles with Goblins and Hobgoblins Meepo and we discovered that he was a sorcerer. Apparently
			his innate magical ability manifested during a time of great stress and Meepo realized his power. Lucky for Meepo since
			it kept him alive during our encounters with the filthy Goblins, skeletons and other fiendish things of The Sunless Citadel.</p>
		<p class="indented"> During these events death was close but did not manage to claim our lives. At one point I believed
			Rask dead but Mewn would not give up on him and she saved him with a healing potion. That taught me to always confirm
			life or death even if it looks like death from a distance. Rask had been gutted, apparently, but yet a spark of life remained
			in him. Mewn saved his life and so bringing her along proved good as well. As I said we survived the Goblin fortifications
			and the undead and in the end emerged with considerable treasure and a magical sword that we sold for even more gold.
			I regret to write that the shopkeepers son and the others we were asked to find perished but I am glad to say that we
			managed to avenge their deaths by slaying a mad Druid and his twisted undead and transmogrified minions.</p>
		<p class="indented"> So it is that I find myself in the company of Quadro, The Dwarven Wizard____Rask, of St. Cuthbert___Julin,
			a Bard</p>
		<p class="indented">
			____Meepo-Goblin-Slayer, The Sorcerer____and Mewn.</p>
		<p class="indented"> As a footnote: Barkin also a Dwarf decided to discontinue adventuring because it was too dangerous.
			Perhaps he knows best - only time will tell.</p>
		<p class="indented"> Once we returned to Oakhurst with our treasure I decided to give a wayward Gnome my home in the woods
			since he had no place to live and had been a captive for 2 years of the stinking-filth that is any Goblin. I decided quickly
			that I did not need my home any longer since the group would be leaving for larger towns perhaps a city to sell the statues,
			jewels and art we found in The Sunless Citadel. I feel compelled to wander again anyway. But my mind stays with home as
			well. Especially since my mind cast about for what to put in my 90th letter.</p>
		<p class="indented"> I left home 6 years ago in defiance of my highly regimented life. My father Tenzanier Daerkwood helped
			to order my mind and shape my sense of self. It was his teachings to never give up and to always see good, if possible,
			in any situation and to never surrender all of whom I am to anyone or anything. Those teachings aided me as much as the
			companions with me during the battles in the citadel. I feel the need to trance so I will cease writing for now. I will
			have to finish letter 90 later. I have some time since we will be in Oakhurst awhile.</p>

			<h2>Entry Two</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> I am writing this sitting perhaps 10 feet from an altar and what could be called an obelisk.. Total
		evil is all I can think of to describe the altar and the dire items we found inside the obelisk. Mewn tapped on a black
		drum and the altar grew translucent and then an eye scanned the room and most of us felt an ill effect. A great weakness
		and for those not directly harmed I could tell it caused a sense of dread. The drum was one of the items inside the obelisk.
		I don't know what the chimes or the small metal ball does but don't want to know first hand. We found a scroll as well.
		It describes a terrible ritual of some kind, this also I don't care to experience first hand nor do I wish such things
		on the world. I know evil exists. That hate and violence and other baneful things exist with a purpose of their own. But
		yet I have never felt a heavy heart like I did when the altar eye "looked" over the room.</p>
	<p class="indented"> How the troop arrived in the room with the altar is lengthy but I can summarize it easily enough. In
		Oakhurst I met with my parents again for the first time in 6 years. Menyoh obviously told Tenzanier and Marahnaiol where
		I had been living because she wanted to relay a personal message to me about our engagement and knew she would also give
		Tenzanier a reason to find me and ask me to come home. Tenzanier though he is my father would never have come 100 miles
		to find me own his own merits. Menyoh, my love, gave my mother and father a reason to travel and find me and ask me to
		return while saving their pride. After some debate I agreed to return home and marry Menyoh. I asked only that they respect
		that I wanted to travel to Verbobonc to sell and buy items we could not sell or purchase in Oakhurst. My father agreed.
		I told the troop I wanted to travel to Verbobonc with them but afterward I needed to return home.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Along the way we met Grawl, a Gnoll and Tyro who practices the old religion. Tyro was a catalyst to
		cause our group to travel from Verbobonc to a place called Homlet. I did not care to travel to Homlet on what I thought
		was erroneous reasons but none the less we traveled to find Jaroo. Jaroo is a Druid like Tyro and is in fact the mentor
		of Tyro. Tyro suspects Jaroo of something. Tyro could only tell us that Jaroo was acting strange, keeping things secret
		from him and "hiding" something. What. Huh. What. As Mewn said: 3 perfectly good questions. Tyro could tell us nothing
		and yet somehow the troop decided to travel to Homlet to help this Tyro person find his Mentor Jaroo and "force" Jaroo
		to reveal what he is "hiding" I disagreed with this but I was not heeded.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Once we arrived at Homlet Tyro took us to the home of Jaroo. A small wooden cabin in the middle of
		deep woods was our destination. Once at the place Jaroo was no place to be found. Tyro decided he was one of the troop
		(I think) at this point and continued to follow us even after clearly we (The Troop) would no longer look for Jaroo. But
		it was I whom was incorrect again as to what the troop would do.</p>
	<p class="indented"> On the way to Homlet I made it clear that I would return home if finding Jaroo was not possible within
		a short period - for a human not an elf - or if Jaroo was found and nothing sinister was afoot. I also asked the troop
		to accompany me to my home and join in the wedding. I believed the troop (I include Grawl when I say troop but not Tyro.
		Not yet.) would go "home" with me and meet my love Menyoh. Again I was incorrect; I somehow misunderstood concerning what
		the troop had in mind. After finding none of the troop cared to go with me I parted company with them and began to make
		my way home. I never made it home or very far from the troop for that matter.</p>
	<p class="indented"> After parting company with the troop I started thinking about all of them. Some of what I thought is
		during my ride alone and some of it comes in retrospect after battles that got us to the altar and obelisk. But during
		my time alone I thought mostly of Mewn and Quadro. </p>
	<p class="indented"> A human woman raised Mewn. So it gives her an urgency to get some place in her life in a hurry. Mewn
		takes things day-by-day and "feels" time the way humans do. She is lucky and unlucky in this fashion. Mewn will, I doubt,
		never know the peace of moving through the seasons and years. To do nothing but enjoy sun, storm, cold and wind, friends
		and long poems and stories that last hours. These things are a part of me not something I go through. Mewn fights the seasons
		and resists sitting in one place to enjoy time and the spaces between now and what will come to pass. Mewn thinks in terms
		of day and night not season and year. If Mewn speaks of soon she means in a few days at best and usually she is referring
		to hours or minutes. If I say soon I could mean perhaps several months or even a year or more. In this we are different.
		I find her humanity refreshing and at the same time know she is missing out on what has been given her by birthright. Mewn
		is a paradox - a woman with a human mind-set but an Elven body that was made to walk through the years like humans walk
		through one room in their home to another room in that same home. Mewn you have the time to become and be and grow and
		change. You need not rush from place to place and work so hard to learn things and fit yourself into the world. Enjoy the
		world. Sit and watch some of it go by and soon you will find yourself and know what it is you want to guide your life toward.
		I wonder what she would think if she read this entry?</p>
	<p class="indented"> Quadro is a Dwarf and a Wizard. Dwarven Wizard is not something one sees often. Quadro has a self-assured
		mind set in many ways but is unsure enough of his choices to ever assume others would be willing to follow his orders.
		I thought Quadro would become the troop leader but after awhile Quadro presented a tendency to let Julin or someone else
		lead. Quadro is learning quickly how to fight with the axe he purchased. I have been helping him learn to strike with it
		while also serving a secondary goal of firewood for the night. Quadro is impatient at times but not in a pushing way. Quadro
		is impatient for his own skills and magical abilities to grow. Quadro pushes himself to learn new things like using armor
		and melee weapons while working equally hard on maintaining his Wizardry. Quadro has endeared himself to me in many ways.
		Quadro is teaching me Magic and Quadro is accepting of others and takes insults or setbacks with ease for the most part.
		Quadro does not let his race and the preconceptions others have of what a Dwarf should do or not do color how he lives
		his life. Grawl is a Gnoll and to be honest dangerous looking and Quadro used his heart instead of his eyes or any preconceptions
		of what a Gnoll is or is not to make a judgement on if Grawl was trustworthy. Quadro is eager to do battle and with zeal
		throws himself into every battle. Quadro favors fighting hand-to-hand and saves his spells until he really needs them.
		I feared his hands-on approach to battle as opposed to the detachment Magic allows him to have in a confrontation would
		get Quadro into serious troubles some day. Quadro chooses not to hang back or let others protect him unless absolutely
		necessary. He is strong and able but the strongest among us have been terribly hurt. Mewn and Rask have met death at the
		door.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Grawl is a powerhouse and a deadly fighter. Grawl saved Mewn from either a nasty wound or a nasty death.
		Grawl sensed or saw evil Gnolls that were about to ambush Mewn and Grawl killed one of his own kind with a single swing
		of his axe in order to protect Mewn. The troop needs Grawl for his muscle and his senses.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Rask is willing to meet challenges and martyr himself for the troop. Rask is not self-destructive but
		still he puts himself into danger when he need not do so in order to heal us or do battle hand-to-hand. Rask is rash at
		times but his faith is mighty and his power to destroy the undead or thwart the powers of other clerics that worship evil
		ends is not only amazing but expected and counted on by the troop. Without Rask none of us would be alive right now. Rask
		has a temper and when ignited serves to fuel his faith and power to defeat evil. Rask has a will to live that got him through
		a near death experience. Mewn may have healed his body with a potion but Rask in my opinion forced his soul to remain in
		a body, it should have vacated, by sheer force of will. This will to survive and thwart evil will serve Rask well in this
		coming time.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Julin is the minstrel and though he is brash and disrespectful some of the time I have never questioned
		his loyalty to the troop. Things have gone bad for us and Julin maintains his glibness and his toothy wits. His songs give
		us courage or strength and I would dare even say speed at times. Julin is concerned over treasure but not so much as to
		ignore life and limb. I hope. I think. Julin has been lucky.</p>
	<p class="indented"> As I said I parted ways with the troop and along the road I thought about each of them and now I write
		what I was thinking then into these pages. I sit and stare at the altar and wonder where we will be led next and will we
		survive the next few days or even this coming day?</p>
	<p class="indented"> After parting with the troop I met a man on the road and he told me he had encountered a group that
		was insisting on going to the moat house even though the man on the road told them a Dragon resided at the moat house.
		I asked for a description of this group and realized it was the troop. I thought they might get killed fighting a Dragon.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Without knowing exactly what I could do I headed for the moat house with all due haste. When I arrived
		I saw a blue Dragon that was larger than my horse flying over the moat house and the troop in disarray trying to battle
		the beast. I rode toward the drawbridge and took 2 hasty shots and luckily hit the beast. Or not lucky, depends on how
		one sees it. The blue Dragon attacked me diving in and winging past me. With a withering strike it nearly threw me from
		my horse and blood splattered my face and flew into the air. I saw my blood explode from the terrible wound and yet all
		I could think of was protecting the troop. I made a snap decision to fight to save the troop to help slay the dragon or
		die.</p>
	<p class="indented">I put my horse between the dragon and me and fired 2 more arrows. The 1st shot missed and the 2nd glancing
		the dragon but did not hurt it as far as I could tell. The Dragon reached past my horse with its jagged claws and massive
		arm and struck me again. I remember firing my bow but then I saw only darkness. When I awoke I found my friends had driven
		the dragon away from me. Rask and Tyro had healed me. The troop had stuck the dragon telling blows. I arose and followed
		the dragon outside the moat house. Quadro and Julin close behind me. The dragon roared saying we would all die. It expelled
		lightning from its mouth. I dodged most of the blast but still tendrils of blue energy illuminated my body and a terrible
		stinging pain racked my bones. The brunt of the line of lightning struck Quadro. I saw a shower of sparks and what looked
		like steam and blue yellow mist exploded from all around Quadro and from his chest specifically. The dragon was gloating
		and I felt Quadro could be dead. This en-angered me I went closer to the beast and took aim. I struck the creature with
		the arrows I let loose. The 2 arrows found home in its neck. It roared and then fell dying. I asked for an axe to behead
		the creature. Grawl beheaded the vile thing for me.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Quadro was dead. He lay charred and still upon the ground. Mewn was crying and I felt she might give
		in to her emotions and become lost to us so I ordered her down from the wall and to come to the group and help. I began
		giving orders. I wanted Quadro returned to life and Rask said he would take care of it not to worry. Rask left with Quadro
		to travel to the temple of St. Cuthbert. Quadro could be raised from the dead but even I knew having heard Yonn (A cleric
		and mother of Menyoh) speak of it that raising someone from the dead would have drawbacks. When returned to life Quadro
		would "forget" some things and be exhausted for some while. But I felt Quadro being so full of life would want life again
		and I hope Quadro would do the same for me so Quadro was returned to life and came back the following morning with Rask
		whom managed to get a cleric to raise dead. How he did this I do not know but it no longer matters. Quadro is back and
		things are set right again. A number of other things happened too but all of them so far pale in comparison to the dragon
		and the impact it placed upon me.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> I am not a hero. If I were Quadro would not have had to die. I arrived at the moat house and promptly
		became mortally wounded. Had it not been for Tyro and Rask I would have perished too. Okay Tyro is part of the troop. But
		I still don't know him well.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> So I sit here writing in this book and looking at the sleeping troop thinking to myself about the overwhelming
		evil we are choosing to face. Can we even hope to best an ancient cult that is willing to die so very handily for their
		vile secrets and causes. And just how greater is overwhelming than being whelmed I find myself wondering. Mewn is eyeing
		me and writing in her journal as well. I sense a kinship with her whenever I write in this book. Strange I don't really
		see Mewn as Elven for some reason as much as I see her as just Mewn. She is a human trapped in an Elven body. I wonder
		what she would think if she read this entry?</p>
	<p class="indented"> To the troop: Life is training for us every day. Though failure is possible we must claim the moment.
		Become the moment. For if we cannot endure today then when will we?</p>
	<p class="indented"> Odd, I smile inwardly no one will ever know I wrote this. So why did I address it to the troop? Because
		I know I shall no longer be with them one day.</p>
	<p class="indented">

			<h2>Entry Three</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> Mishap and misunderstanding are 2 words that do not sound ill by themselves. But I fear these mishaps
		and misunderstanding bode ill for us in the future. They have proved ill now and could be ill again later and certainly
		will be thought of as ill by me from now on.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Mishaps: I shot Mewn in the back with an arrow. Mewn was hurt but did not think badly of me for accidentally
		shooting her. I made an apology and after Rask healed Mewn everything was "fine" again as far as I know. I made a second
		apology shortly after the first one and seeing Mewn was understanding of the accident and forgave me I made nothing else
		of it.</p>
	<p class="indented"> During another fight that same day the troop and I were surrounded by a mist that obscured sight. It
		was as a dense fog. I attacked and struck Meepo with my Rapier. Meepo forgave me too.</p>
	<p class="indented">I thought I had killed Meepo for a moment. I am glad I did not slay little Meepo. I made 2 apologies
		to Meepo too and after I saw he forgave me I made nothing else of it as well.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Julin said the name of a God and was struck down. I rushed to him and tried to find a place he was
		injured. He was not wounded yet he lay dying. Rask attempted to heal Julin. This had no effect what-so-ever. After a short
		moment Julin sprang back hale again and promptly told us he had spoken to a God and that it asked him some questions. A
		ceremonial dagger appeared near Julin with his name written upon it. The dagger is all black and I believe it bodes ill
		things for the future, at least for Julin if not for us all. The God Julin spoke the name of is The Elder Elemental Eye
		or The eye guy as Mewn keeps calling him. Better to call him anything but his true name since doing so gets you a personal
		audience and a black dagger with your name blazed upon it.</p>
	<p class="indented"> We got into a fight with more creatures and things went against us for a while. Mewn was ambushed and
		to make it worse she was at the end of a narrow hallway connecting 2 rooms. Me, Julin and Tyro along with his wolf entered
		the hallway to assist Mewn. Julin shouted to fall back after seeing Mewn was free of the creatures that had been attacking
		her. Tyro, his wolf companion and me covered Mewn as she escaped back to where Rask and Quadro were. Mewn needed healing
		and Rask healed her while the rest of us maneuvered out of the hallway to get a better defensible position against our
		enemies. Julin was correct fighting in the hall would hinder us and help the enemy.</p>
	<p class="indented"> After we all got into position to combat our foes that were regrouping and preparing an attack. I saw
		Rask move past me and into the hallway. Julin and I told him not to go but Rask attacked the remaining Gnolls. Mewn took
		off down the hallway and assisted Rask. As it went both survived and slew the Gnolls. After the battle I wanted to discuss
		leader and focus on how we could better help one another in close combat. I was concerned for Rask since shielding Mewn
		with magic and fighting tooth-and-nail could be too much on him. I wanted to explain to Rask that if Mewn is attacked and
		hurt badly and he, because of shielding Mewn, could take considerable harm when doing so and if while he is hand-to-hand
		fighting he is also hit by his opponent then he (Rask) could die. Julin was being very insulting to Rask at the time we
		were trying to vote for leader and discuss the hallway occurrence. I understand why Julin was insulting Rask to some degree
		because what Rask did could have impacted us all. It did not however cause any lasting harm. During the discussion about
		the hallway incident and choosing a leader for our group Rask became irate. Rask tossed away the ring that he had been
		using to shield Mewn and walked briskly away saying he would leave if no one wanted him around or needed him in the group.
		Mewn called Rask to come back. He wavered for a few moments then returned. Rask chose to put the ring back upon his finger.
		I could tell Mewn was hurt by what Rask did with the ring. Mewn probably felt Rask was throwing about her and his friendship
		symbolically as if it was trivial.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		After Rask cooled down Quadro was officially voted leader of the group. Quadro is a good choice and I respect him. But I
		don't know if Quadro is ready to give orders that might contribute to or knowingly cause death. We shall see and if I am
		any judge we shall see promptly indeed. Situations are progressing and dangers are becoming commonplace to us. I don't
		know why Rask became angry with me and retorted that we did not need him. I entrusted Quadro to Rask alone. I trusted Rask
		to have Quadro Gemini raised from the dead on nothing more than his word. I believed Rask could make it safely back to
		town though he went alone save the corpse of Quadro.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I trusted Rask but now I feel differently. Rask and I are no longer friends. I will help him as any
		member of the group but I if we are not adventuring and are in town, or more to the point, not in danger or planning our
		next move I do not care to associate with Rask. I have no anger toward him and he did not hurt me with his words or his
		actions. I simply do not wish to spend time with someone who chooses hostility and threats when calm words suffice to deal
		with disagreements. Rask threatened Julin and I find that unacceptable behavior from someone I entrust my life to day and
		night. Perhaps his actions were unique to the one situation and it was all a misunderstanding and not the true Rask. I
		will watch, wait and see what is to be proved out where his character is concerned.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Now to speak of brighter matters in a few days Menyoh will arrive in Homlin. I have sent for her and
		have no doubt she will come to my side. I have known her for 96 years and want to marry her more now than ever. To be wed
		in Homlin will not be ideal but it will suffice because in my heart Menyoh abides and in my life is where I wish her to
		be. In 40 of her 90 letters to me Menyoh spoke of joining me in my self-imposed exile and so now it will come to pass.
		Menyoh will arrive in Homlin and I will ask her to marry me. I will buy a ring in Verbobonc for her since I sold the one
		I'd planned to give her to purchase supplies.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> I wonder what Mewn, Quadro, Meepo, Julin and Tyro will think of Menyoh? It would be good if Menyoh
		liked them as well. I should think she will meet the group and be amazed at what we have done and gone through together.
		Menyoh will thrill at the stories Julin, Mewn and Quadro will tell her. She will also marvel at a Kobold Sorcerer whom
		has a heart of gold. I look forward to the reunion of Menyoh and myself.</p>

			<h2>Entry: 4</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> Things are falling apart. Julin and Rask got into an argument over flour in the Mill house and their
		loud bickering caused us trouble. The enemies we went to seek out were ready to defend and fight us when we came upon them.
		Julin accused Rask of stealing a bag of flour. Granted that was true Rask was going to take a fresh bag of flour. Rask
		then took an empty bag and began filling it with flour from off the floor.. Julin decided that was stealing the bag and
		the flour. I don't think the flour on the floor is used for anything but I could be mistaken. The argument continued for
		some time giving our enemies time to plan how to kill us. No matter thievery or not yelling at Rask and alerting the enemy
		was a mishap. Rask did not help by being loud either.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Mewn, Quadro, Meepo and Tyro were hurt badly and were knocked to the floor as a result of the enemy
		being ready for us upon entering the room at the Mill house. I was struck with magical missiles and dazed by some sort
		of magic effect so I only got off one shot against the wizard woman who struck me with magical missiles but I did hit her
		soundly. We came close to being overwhelmed and slain but managed to win in spite of the bickering. Pointless as it was
		it meant a lot to Julin and Rask to argue just then. I suppose they figured it was worth all our lives. It was not.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I don't know why but these people resist having a true leader. I asked Quadro to do something and take
		a commanding stance concerning the group. Quadro said he was only Co-combat leader and he did not have the authority. If
		Rask and Julin are going to argue like that at the temple of all consumption we're almost sure to be killed.</p>
	<p class="indented">I will not gladly die for the cause of good but I will die if I must and if my death saves others or
		prevents atrocity or such other heinous event. I do not wish to be a hot meal served upon a plate of disagreement and mistrust.
		Nor do I fancy dying for other hollow reasons than involve ego or self-gratification on the part of another. My life and
		those of the people I travel with mean something to me. I am not friends with Rask but don't want to see him dead. I am
		becoming close friends with Mewn and so care for her safety considerably. I think Mewn is getting tired of the Julin/ Rask
		three ring circuses of fits and fussing? Actually watching her expressions I know she is unhappy. Mewn needs to focus her
		energies on other things than arguments over treasure and corn meal.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Tyro has lost his mentor. Jaroo was killed and replaced with a shape shifter that posed as Jaroo. I
		expect this upset Tyro more than he shows. Tyro told me he had nothing to stay for any longer and could he officially join
		our group. I told him yes though in retrospect I should have asked the entire group.</p>
	<p class="indented"> _____ _ __ _____ _ _ ___ ______ __ _ _ __ _______________ _ _</p>
	<p class="indented"> I put the journal down for a bit so I drew a line where I stopped to think for what turned out to be
		two hours. I just drew a quick line and walked off for awhile thinking. It seemed the thing to do. I am realizing that
		we do need a leader or at least to trust each other. A huge argument came to boil over some gold and items we had earned
		during our adventures. The loot was discussed and Julin and Rask got into serious words over the treasures. I asked Quadro
		to do something and he said he could not because our agreement of how to divide loot was not written down and signed. I
		was amazed my word was not enough to seal the agreement. We are a group that live together, fight and defend each other
		against foes that seek our grizzly death and with all this we cannot agree on what to do with loot. Apparently we need
		a signed agreement before Quadro will act or before Julin and Rask will trust one another. This is unacceptable to me.
		I hoped Quadro would emerge as true leader of the group but as I see it now things are becoming splintered and raw. "We"
		disagree over trifles and while doing so our lives are endangered by our own hand. As my father told me on my 100th birthday:
		Never agree with the disagreeable if the disagreement agrees with those that agree to harm you or find ill will with your
		generosity.. I never gave that much thought till now. If those I take refuge with disagree so much that it causes or can
		cause you harm and supports even accidentally the agenda of those that wish to undo you then remove yourself from such
		disagreements. That is what I think that bit of fatherly wisdom means. I find myself longing for home and hearth and to
		see Menyoh. My life may well be headed for an early end but I have a duty to the group and myself to help end the evils
		that are afoot. For good or ill the DI has been cast and my fortune bound to people such as I am with. But I am not without
		hope or means to change my course.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I have decided to implore that we have a true leader. I will champion Quadro for the role of leader.
		If an agreement can be made of who will be our leader and the leader shows he/she can unify and give the group purpose
		I feel we stand an even chance against our foes. If not then I feel I must take actions that I do not care to take and
		speak not as a Daerkwood. I, if needs be, will abandon my fathers teachings of how to relate to those not of my way of
		belief and thinking. I will demand things be done as some of those in the group have demanded things. Placing myself in
		a corner and forcing a decision could result in expulsion from the group but doing nothing until someone dies would be
		a greater travesty. If nothing else I can return to Homlin find Menyoh, journey home and gather help from my family and
		friends to thwart the evil forces that infest the temples, dungeons and ruined places. But doing this is of last resort
		and, I pray, unnecessary. Perhaps Mewn, Grawl, Quadro, Meepo and Tyro will come with me? Even if Julin and Rask don't care
		to have a leader or anything else except an argument. Perhaps none of them will join me. Though disappointment would plague
		me, as I travel home with Menyoh, that my friends did not come with me or that I left some of the group I must do what
		my heart whispers. My heart whispers for unity and peace with those I trust my life with. Disagreement and problems arise
		but should not lead to mistrust, hatred or such rancorous anger. Avoiding these negative things will help the group be
		more able to deal with the threats we face. Embracing mistrust, anger and hatred will bring us to a lonely, quiet place
		indeed, our grave.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I keep going back in my mind to what my family has taught me of behaving and teamwork and accountability.
		Their most sage advice I fear fails me where the group I am with is concerned. We have goals and no plans of how to achieve
		them. In fact I believe some of the group does not know what it is we are trying to do or uncover. Where will we go next.
		Julin wants to go to the main temple proper. I think in our present state of disarray that is a bad idea. We cannot fight
		fanatics and those devout to the cause of returning a dark god to Oerth and be unfocused and unfriendly to one another
		as we have been. I keep calling us a group and say "we" but honestly we are a group of individuals with goals that range
		from noble to noxious. What is the answer. Is there more out there than I have been handed. Certainly adventurers exist
		and can be found that are wiser, better equipped, and more experienced at dealing with such evils than us. I know a hero
		or 3 must be walking the land as I write this in search of some grand and noble cause to undertake. If this land depends
		on only this group then I despair at what shall become of all good-loving folk.. Mayhap The Circle of 8 shall become involved.
		Bigby and Otto are spoken of with generous regard as good souls at the School of Tal. My father Tenzanier is an enchanter
		and my mother is a Sorcerer and psionic. I would not dare call them powerful but strong comes to mind. Those of the School
		of Tal are or have been adventurers. In fact Deven Arkay takes a sabbatical every other year, so I have been told, to go
		on certain journeys. Deven has come back with strange items or large gems and after such a sabbatical Deven Arkay always
		donates considerable gold to the small temple to Rao and gives gems and most his strange items to the wizard school. Deven
		Arkay is actually, now that I think about it, a celebrity of sorts. Arkay is 35 years older than I am yet we have much
		in common. My father use to have him over to our home for meals and Arkay would play with my younger brother and me. Humans
		found Deven Arkay at age 18 wondering around a burning wagon and crying for his parents. I remember the story well.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Deven Arkay was taken in by humans at age 18 and cared for by them for 36 years until a wondering bard,
		the brother of Geggen Amakiir found Arkay and told him of his father Geggan and mother Nunaleem Amakiir. At hearing this
		Deven returned to the Kron hills and his remaining Elven family. Out of respect Arkay keeps the name his human "parents"
		gave him but in all other ways acts and reacts as an Elven man, for the most part. Arkay never did find the bandits that
		slew his father and mother but it is a closed chapter in his life as now. Remembrance is strong upon me and though the
		night groans toward morning I care more to write about the past than to trance or think of the present or my future. I
		could write so much more about things I have done and seen and those I was close to in childhood I have grown away from
		now but what good does it do me. Mewn said the point of the journal was to write in it and look back at it later and see
		how things changed in my life. As I write now I see that things have changed indeed. My childhood friends are teachers
		or mercantile owners or true scholars. Kunu is a scholar. She is the first girl I ever kissed. Menyoh is the third and
		XioXoe Ulalume was the first woman I ever saw naked. XioXoe is beautiful to this day but her passions are for old tomes
		and hidden or forgotten things. Kunu often helps XioXoe decipher books, scrolls or tablets. Once Xio disappeared for 7
		years and returned with slabs of rock from Blackmoor. Not long after Kunu and Xio began translating the slabs the curious
		slabs were absconded. Who took them is a mystery. It is talked about often and a story of some intrigue. The story will
		have life breathed into it by one tale or another for ages. Of course one account is terrifically out proportioned and
		involves a harrowing battle with those shadowy figures that took the slabs. A battle never occurred but Xio and Kunu did
		see shadowy figures. Both women were disabled by poison from darts that the mysterious intruders used upon them. Of course
		not before Kunu could cry out and alert the night guards of the library. This call for alarm by Kunu is rumored to be all
		that saved the scholars from death. However the poison paralyzed them for a short time and after this effect ended nothing
		else ill came of the attack. Since that day Kunu or XioXoe have never seen such mystery bandits again or had such a tale
		to tell that would not be boring except to the bookish or some sage.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I do grow weary now and if I do not trance I shall be doing so even after Julin is afoot.. And Julin
		sleeps a lot even for a human. I guess singing and insulting Rask is hard work and so Julin needs his rest as he can get
		it. Pondering my Elven friends makes me realize that except for Szasz all my friends have been Elven until I met Barkin,
		Rask, Julin, Quadro, Meepo, Tyro and Grawl. What a strange lot to be gathered about me. How quickly have I met so many
		people different than myself it brings me uneasy pause. Perhaps Barkin was correct when he told me that without a leader
		we were doomed. Barkin left our group because we had no leader and recommended I should do the same. I respect you too
		Barkin yet I cannot walk away from what is put before me. I seek to become more than what I am now. I seek the heart of
		a hero. I seek within myself for the truth of what I am made of in earnest. The depth of my character I call into question.
		The question is answerable by inner voice alone. What, if anything, will this voice say. Hero, ordinary soul, fool or coward?</p>

			<h2>Entry: 5</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> On the way to The Temple of Elemental Evil Mewn was killed. This grieved me deeply and I was hard set
		to keep my composure. Mewn wants something out of life so I knew that this time, perhaps never again, she would return
		when the Clerics called her soul back to the body. Mewn wants to find her family and this is a driving goal and so raising
		her from the dead is and was possible. I felt that she almost did not want to return in my heart but the thought of family
		tugs at her heart and her soul alike. Mewn all is not lost now that you have returned. You have a chance to find your family
		still and you have a renewed chance to live again. Look into yourself and live, find reasons to look past your death. I
		will help you Mewn in what ways I can. Mewn looked haunted and her behavior was reckless and her attitude dark just after
		her return to the living. Though only gone one day this event darkened her spirit. I feared she might become lost to us
		once more but my fears were short lived and unwarranted, for the most part, because Mewn conquered her inner demons involving
		her death and return to life. Or at least she took hold of her darker emotions and subdued them to the place from wince
		they came. Mewn I marvel at your strength, keep your chin up and your head held high - may you ever have such resolve that
		cannot be squelched.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> Things went quickly as we traveled back to Homlin. Menyoh was awaiting me and I was glad to see her.
		Menyoh and I were married in Homlin but I will not write of this now since my attitude is darkly sober. I shall save such
		a happy event for when I am more at ease with myself.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Upon arriving back to Homlin we went to the Moat house again with the torch of revealing and we found
		that a purple gem held up, by great magic, the obelisk. If not for the torches magical powers of revelation we would be
		ignorant of this possibly important fact. How the purple gem is important or if it is a clue or a means of anything to
		us is beyond my current reasoning. Mewn touched the gem and disappeared and reappeared atop the obelisk moments later.
		Quadro and Julin did the same and some dark spirit gave each that did this a black apple. This evil creature told them
		some things I do not understand about freeing it from its dark prison. Julin was sure that it was the same voice that gave
		him the black dagger with his name upon it. I think this will bode ill for Julin more now than ever and I am concerned
		for Quadro and Mewn. We found no other treasures in the Moat house and so we traveled to The Temple of Elemental Evil.</p>
	<p class="indented"> We reached a town that was no longer a town at all but the wild things that grew did not completely
		destroy the mark of a place once civilized. Buildings still stood though hard pressed not to fall in or be overgrown by
		whimsical nature and her eternal handiwork. Ill foreboding crossed over me as Quadro entered a building. I stood in the
		doorway ready to defend him but from what I could not have said then and yet guarded I stood. After a moment something
		surreal came into focus. It was like a man yet not. An apparition of sorts shimmered and with a sword struck Quadro whom
		had his back turned to the apparition. Quadro called out in pain, staggered then fell rigid. I saw the apparition, a ghost,
		shimmer away and then reappear. Hastily I ran in and grabbed Quadro from off the floor. I pulled him into a corner of the
		building. Others of the group were coming in and taking up weapons against the ghost. Julin shouted that only magical things
		could truly harm the ghost creature. What Quadro taught me I now used to protect us both from the undead evil. I hefted
		Quadro upon my shoulder and cast Shield. I knew Quadro was hurt and if this ghost struck him again I believed Quadro would
		be slain by its malevolence. Julin shouted, a resonating sound burst forth and the ghost was struck soundly by the energies
		Julin loosed. To no avail we fought it. Even the power of Rask to cower down or destroy undead was of no use. The brightest
		light ever I have seen, as yet, came from the holy symbol of St. Cuthbert and the ghostly evil remained undaunted. Not
		beaten by it but unable to harm it each of us knew fighting it would end our lives if we remained. We retreated to the
		overgrown road and found that again Julin was correct about the ghost. Julin recalled that ghosts could only travel about
		in certain areas and thusly only be dangerous in the place it was fettered to. The ghostly man could not leave the building
		and what's more the weapon it was using melted away upon crossing the threshold of the house. It could not come after us
		and so we backed away and left it be. I will return one day and destroy the ghost with magic but for now it gets a reprieve.
		Nulb is an evil place indeed and as so it is befitting it reside so close to The Temple of Elemental Evil.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Worth note: Quadro was appointed leader of our group. Julin argued a considerable amount but the vote
		came down to Quadro and me and in a close vote Quadro won leadership. I should note that I voted for Quadro. I assume that
		Julin will continue to have problems with a true leader and such troubles will have to be dealt with as they come. I can
		only hope that Quadro is fair and unbiased as I think. I would not have voted for Quadro if I thought he could be a puppet
		of one member of the group or make unrealistic demands. Yet I worry now that I have pressed the matter. I may have influenced
		Mewn and Tyro to vote for Quadro. If Quadro fails as leader blame must be placed upon me also. Good luck Quadro your job
		will never be easy and can be nothing, most of the time, other than complicated.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Once we arrived near The Temple of Elemental Evil we camped out there. Julin and I shared a tent and
		the others slept as they chose. Rask seemed a little sick later on but in the night we got a visitor. A half-human woman
		named Kellah arrived and put out our fire. To our chagrin she told us of the dangers of lighting a fire so close to a place
		of evil. I realized she was correct and I admire her fire. Hope I spelled your name correctly. Kellah reminds me of Menyoh
		the way she put things bluntly to us. This night visitor said she would be watching us and wanted to protect the forest
		above all else but wanted to warn us none the less.</p>
	<p class="indented"> In The Temple of Elemental Evil we battled several times and during one battle we came across a foe
		that possessed a magical bow. This foe is dead now and I wield his bow. I gave the bow I once had to Quadro. Mewn was instrumental
		in helping slay the enemy that possessed the magic bow. Using of all things a tangle foot bag to impede the enemy as he
		tried to escape and warn others. What I did not know then was that in a short while the largest battle of our group career
		as adventurers was about to unfold. This battle would nearly kill us all and would end the life of one of us in a terrifying
		manner.
	</p>
	<p class="indented">
		After some hasty plans on our part we charged into a room where enemies waited with grim determination to end our lives.
		Hobgoblins in shining armor or robes stood in the back of the room and goblins, dire apes and even 4 trained dogs blocked
		our path to these hobgoblins.</p>
	<p class="indented">The battle was joined with not a thunderous crash or blood but with the casting of a spell that put
		thick mist within the room. Obscuring mist was the spell, I have seen it before, and when I saw it employed by the enemies
		I grimaced.. Our hasty plans, quick and as simple as they be, were nullified before any value could be gotten from them.
		I don't know what happened next but it appeared that everyone was going into the mist. I, still outside the mist, fired
		an arrow at a lizard creature I believed to be the familiar of a hobgoblin wizard. I drew blood and the creature clicked
		with a loud and dismaying sound. The creature scuttled into the mist and a blue-green flash illuminated the fog and Julin
		cried out. To my amazement he kept singing though I could tell Julin had been harmed. Unable to see within the fog I tried
		to kill what enemies outside the mist that I could see and to some effect I succeeded. Then I heard Julin, in the mist
		still, cry out. His singing stopped and I knew things were starting to go badly. I ordered Rask to go into the mist and
		find Julin. Rask hesitated then agreed. A short while after that I saw Rask and Julin at the edge of the mist. I yelled
		for everyone to get out of the mist and come to my voice but those still inside the mist were having trouble fighting the
		enemies. I myself became preoccupied in short order by an enemy that kept coming though I wounded him badly. Injury after
		injury was weighing me down as well. I traded strike for strike with my foe but yet he tasked me. My resolve fell and I
		felt I might die. A pounding in my chest coupled with anxious dread overcame me. I saw Mewn behind the foe that advanced
		upon me even as I searched for help from someone to help me fight him. Mewn was in trouble too and hobgoblins, goblins
		and dire apes surrounded her and Rask.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		Where were Meepo, Grawl and Quadro. I knew Quadro managed to burn away most of the mist with a fireball spell but some mist
		still obscured my sight and I could not hear or see Quadro but I thought I kept hearing Meepo. I realized I did hear Meepo
		and I asked him to use his magic. Meepo did as I asked even though 3 dogs attacked little Meepo. I could not see Meepo
		but I heard his magic strike out and I heard his grunts of pain as those damnable dogs tore into him. Just then a rousting
		roar comes from the edge of the fogy mist still in place and I knew Grawl was dealing death and this dealt me hope. Tyro
		was yelling something and then I saw Mewn and noticed she was slicing into one enemy after another but still she was getting
		hurt. I could see Rask taking punishment too. All this I noticed in heartbeats of time and then my attention was again
		focused upon the foe that beset me more than any hobgoblin ever I have faced.</p>
	<p class="indented"> The battle with the enemies wore on and the dire apes began to become a grave danger to us. Grawl suddenly
		appeared at the edge of the mist and I saw him thrust his axe between the legs of one of the hobgoblins.. Blood splattered
		Grawl as the axe churned carnage. The enemy fell writhing. A dire ape attacked Grawl and it grabbed him quickly. I heard
		and witnessed Grawl being torn open by the massive ape. The ribcage of Grawl torn open shocked me and I was struck a telling
		blow just then. I could fight no more. Still standing I tried to back away but hopelessness and pain froze me. In that
		moment a fire renewed me. Rask and his divine St. Cuthbert saw fit to heal my wounds. Thank you Rask. Rask was battered
		and bleeding yet he healed me instead. I stepped back and drew the enemy in. Quickly I dropped my bow and unsheathed my
		rapier, 1 strike then a 2nd I luckily landed. The 2nd strike sliced deep the hobgoblin's throat.</p>
	<p class="indented"> After the dire apes and the damnable dogs were dispatched I went over to Julin to see if he was still
		alive. He was, and in not too bad a shape, only unconscious. Grawl was a grizzly and different story. Grawl was torn open
		at the chest and his heart exposed to the open air still throbbed but it was not beating nor was he taking breath. His
		eyes a wild portrait of pain and shock though lifeless. I will be haunted by the sight I am sure of this but more than
		that I will wonder how Mewn is dealing with the death of Grawl. Stunned and bewildered is how I felt. I acted so very calm
		and stoic at the carnage around me and reacted so calmly to my battered and exhausted friends it surprised me somewhat.
		I have never been an open person and reading my face is impossible even for Menyoh, only my mother, father and brother
		can read what is in my eyes. Though Perenthace does it differently than my parents. I wonder if my friends know I care?
		________ __________ ______________ __________ _____</p>
	<p class="indented"> We will take Grawl back and raise him from the dead and hopefully his soul wants to return. The pain
		he must have endured in the short moment before he died. It makes me hollow to consider such dire things. Grawl, Quadro
		and Mewn have died too.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		Three people have died and each time though I was the closest person I failed to be of any help. Quadro stood behind me when
		death took him and it was me that dodged most of the blast from the blue dragon. And it was that blast that killed Quadro.
		I stood beside Mewn when the massive tusked pig the size of a riding horse gored her and slew her. And I was a short 15
		feet from Grawl. Death has been close for me many times but I keep getting saved by someone or I save myself. Mostly I
		get help from the group when my life is near an end. It seems one or more of them come to my aid in the nick-of-time. Thusly
		I am saved. Menyoh said to the group: What are you talking about. Numenarh is not going to do anything to get himself killed.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		I am married and yet I adventure instead of settling down with my love Menyoh. The answer is clear to me what I must do.
		I will send Menyoh back to my family home and write a letter of introduction to my father so that she might be accepted
		and protected by them during this dark time. I will send warning of the staging ground of the enemy in the Kron Hills as
		well. I will get Menyoh out of Homlin before some ill fate befalls her. I should not have asked her to leave her work and
		her life to be with me when I put myself and by association her in such peril every moment. Newly married I have spent
		no time with you my dear Menyoh. I am deeply sorry for not being with you and not being the husband I know your confessed
		dreams describe. Forgive me Menyoh but I must do the hardest thing in my life ever I have done, Not follow my dreams. Instead
		I must follow the perilous road and see what is to be seen and find what is to be found. I wonder will I ever see the end
		to this evil? Will every choice end up for nothing. I think not. I have hope and I have the group and they have me and
		together we are a power to be reckoned with. Together we are heroes.</p>

			<h2>Entry: 6</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> I am writing this time for no other reason than having myself disciplined to do so. I don't have the
		time to write much of anything because of the fact I have named myself Sheriff of a lawless town. When we entered Rastor
		I found it to be unacceptable. The streets of Rastor are mud and the housing is substandard to what I have always known.
		People are apathetic about their lives in Rastor. Why. The group was heading to Rastor in order to locate The Temple of
		All Consumption when a band of Orcish people attacked us, they wanted everything we had. We did not want to give them anything.
		Julin tried to negotiate but they would have none of it. The Orc wanted us to show him our power. Julin struck him with
		his minstrel magic and I fired an arrow into the Orc. After this we were free to pass.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Rastor is a place in need of law and order. I cannot simply let it be as it is. After talking to Hammerstrong
		I felt even more that something needed to be done about the thievery and other ill things. Especially since Hammerstrong,
		a Dwarf said he'd lived here and so had his family before him and Rastor had always been just as it is now. The people
		of this town don't seem to care to make their life better. I did not know if anyone would want a Sheriff or laws to be
		followed and thusly a better life. But I have to try to help the people of Rastor. Something in me spoke to me about this
		town so I felt I could not disregard my own inner thinking just to make life easy for those I adventure with and myself.
		Taking on such a monumental job of bringing law to a town and attempting to change the status quo of deep apathy and smug
		disregard for anything that resembles authority is highly dangerous. I know this and still I have made up my mind about
		it. I asked Julin to pen me an announcement and so he did. I hung the announcements around town and waited to see who wanted
		me as their sheriff and who did not. I expected no one to show but three men did meet with me about the town. The beginnings
		of a jail is in the making as is a garden near the jail and Tyro is gathering seedlings and wild animals for the cause
		of making Rastor reputable.
	</p>
	<p class="indented">
		While in town we discovered that The Temple of All Consumption has wizard directed lightning towers that could too easily
		kill us all. The direct approach is impossible so we will attempt to find, hopefully find, hidden tunnels that lead to
		the dreaded place we seek to infiltrate. I know that what we seek to do is deadly, people have died yet I feel ever more
		that what we do means little. I know it means something though yet I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel concerning
		such mounting evils. I am of 2 minds involving this current set of situations.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I want to bring the people of Rastor a better life. Is such a thing up to me. No. No is my answer yet
		I pursue trying to make Rastor better all the same. Why. What is happening to me. My father would call it righteousness
		and he would say I am dedicating too much of myself to one goal or task. It is folly. My father would call it folly. So
		would my mother. I think Menyoh would tell me to let the town be and come home to the Kron hills and start a family. What
		do I want. I don't know what my life plan is now. I thought it was a life with Menyoh and our children we would have one
		day. But now things have changed so much I fear making Menyoh wait is too much of a strain on even our relationship. Menyoh,
		I know, has fear that I might be harmed or that the quest I undertake will consume all my time and she will be left behind.
		Her fears are not without merit. Dismayed as I am about it I think Menyoh may be correct. Am I an adventurer or a Sheriff
		or a man who wants only the comforts of a close family. I do not fool myself when I write upon these pages and say I want
		to be all these things. There is not time in the day and night to be all these things. Yet I adventure with the group and
		with deep determination seek to make Rastor better. All the while hoping against hope that Menyoh and my family waits for
		me and understands what it is I am trying to help accomplish.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Menyoh was upset that I sent her back to The Kron hills with the letter of introduction but agreed
		to leave as quickly as she could to deliver the message and to return home where my family can protect her. I think her
		good will toward me will not hold if I don't return within the year. Yet I could not guess at the time such endeavors might
		keep me from The Kron Hills and so I could not give her the answer she asked me for. "When will you return home." I could
		only respond by telling her when our quests concerning this manner are done. Menyoh did not like such an open and emotionless
		answer but it is and was all I could say.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I also have 2 concerns involving the group. Tyro is 1 and leaving Grawl to take the brunt of what I
		started is the other. To speak of Grawl 1st he is a strong fellow and I asked him to stay behind and oversee the undertakings
		in Rastor. Though Mewn is our scout I felt the group stood a better chance of finding the hidden tunnels we need to locate
		to enter The Temple of All Consumption if I assisted them. I chose to go with the group though I have even one more obligation
		to fill and no time to do it. It is for a greater purpose of saving lives and thwarting dark purpose so the choice is clear.
		Grawl appears fierce; he is fierce, so this shall work in his favor in my absence from Rastor. I doubt anyone will quarrel
		with Grawl.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		Tyro is my 2nd concern. Tyro threatened Julin. Tyro, the wild told us that his family was slain by Goblins. A goblin surrendered
		during a fight and Tyro would not call off his wolf companion. Julin commanded Tyro to call off the wolf or it would be
		killed. Tyro did not take this too well and said he would not call off the wolf and instead ordered it to attack anew.
		Rask stepped in and pushed back the wolf to save the cowering Goblin. During this interval Tyro threatened that if Julin
		tried to kill his wolf he would kill Julin. This to me is a more serious thing than how Rask acted some time back when
		confronted about engaging the enemy in the hall when the group was pulling back to defend and get in a better offensive
		position as well. Rask never threatened to kill anyone at all but Tyro did and I find this unacceptable. Quadro handled
		the situation between Julin and Tyro that also included Rask peripherally with tact I did not think Quadro possessed. I
		am glad Quadro handled it so artfully yet if this kind of situation arises again with Tyro, the wild it will be me who
		handles the situation - I will not be as tactful or artful as Quadro. Defenseless beings of any sort barring undead I will
		not kill except under very extreme circumstances as occurred at The Sunless Citadel. I do not advocate blind vengeance
		directed toward a race. I hate Goblins as a race in so many ways and while hate is a strong word the hate I feel does not
		rule my heart and mind. I still see right from wrong through the hate I have for the Goblinoid race. I never liked Kobolds
		either until Meepo so I now hold a place in my heart that I could accept any race into the group and into my life as a
		friend. Meepo said that we did not kill him and gave him a chance and we should give the cowering Goblin a chance too.
		The group except Tyro agreed immediately to give the Goblin a chance to live and change its ways. Of course with us each
		step forward sees a setback of some kind.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I was unhappy at the time it took for everyone to take Grawl back to be raised from the dead. When
		Quadro died I set in motion the way in which Quadro could be returned to life as quickly as possible. When Mewn died we
		immediately went back to town to return her from the dead. But Grawl was left to lay unattended after his most terrible
		death. It was apparently more urgent to investigate and find treasure or other enemies or what-have-you than bringing a
		fellow friend and adventurer back to life. I will never understand this reasoning and sudden change of group attitude about
		those that die and what is to be done about it. The group I believed had the unspoken rule of returning to life via Raise
		Dead those that died as soon as possible. I was wrong about what the group would do once more or in this case not do.</p>
	<p class="indented"> The Temple of All Consumption is, surely, very deadly a place to go and we will need every advantage
		we can get if we enter the tunnels. I now wish as I sit here in the deep woods that I had not asked Grawl to stay behind.
		We may need his might and with my asking him to stay behind we will not have such might. My mother once told me: "Each
		decision one makes is never as selfish as one thinks. Others sometimes countless others are affected." My mother is good
		at saying such things and then looking at you a certain way as to let you know she not only believes what she has said
		but what she said has also been lived by her. Unlike my father my mother is a mystery to me. Mostly she is a reserved,
		unassuming and timid housewife but on rare and strange days or more usually rare moments she shines with glorified light.
		The light of wisdom and inner fire burns and changes who she is to me. This rarely seen inner fire makes me wonder what
		kind of life she had before she married. It makes me wonder whom she would be if she had chosen an adventuring life. I
		think what my life would be like had I left with Menyoh for the Kron Hills and surrendered the adventuring life for a life
		of homemaking and teaching. I have sorrow about sending her away and I have sorrow that I chose not to follow my dream
		of a family. I don't know what my life will be like now. No matter how much I write down in this book what I think no better
		decision will be made than what I have already chosen.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I keep looking up from the pages and checking on Mewn. I wrote I didn't have time to write much of
		anything and yet I write on. The fact is I watch over the group the best I can after I trance. The day is dangerous but
		the night could be even more deadly. There is a lot about me that needs puzzling out. If I haven't figured myself out then
		how can anyone else figure me out or give me what I want. I have not figured myself out yet and until I met the group and
		discovered things about The Temple of Elemental Evil I thought I knew whom I was, where I was going and what I would do
		under most any circumstance. What will be my swansong?</p>
	<p class="indented"> Back in Rastor I felt more at ease than I do sitting in the woods. Jardeth, a half-Orc and unofficial
		lawman of Rastor told me he would watch me and see if I intended to really bring lawfulness to Rastor. If I can win Jardeth
		over he will take a more direct stand for organized government and law. I think most people do not want to risk their lives
		or property but none the less want Rastor to be a better place. With the likes of Tuuraug Urkrt, Jardeth and Tymerian my
		hopes are up that Rastor has a chance to be a place I would want to live. Perhaps I am more of a frontier pioneer that
		I thought. The idea of forging homesteads and building something from what once was chaos or for that matter "nothing"
		appeals to me. Adventuring is like pioneer work in that each new day brings the unexpected challenge and if successful
		unexpected rewards too.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		I use to look at the stars wondering what sway they held if any over the course of events. Now I look at the stars and wonder
		what sway if any I have over the course of events in my life and my companions.</p>

	</p>
	<p class="indented"> My father told me my life would have big moments. Moments so meaningful that if I wasn't careful they
		would change who I am and what I represent to others that know me. Tenzanier was right. I faced 2 big moments in 1 day.
		1 day with 2 big moments was overwhelming enough but harder still is realizing the big moment is here. Tenzanier should
		have told me that big moments in life masquerade as choices. Important choices to be sure yet understanding the impact
		of the choices don't come until after rumination. In fact I wish my father were here now so I might spend time in colloquy
		with him. Colloquy is his word not one I esteem to use. I use it to feel closer to my family so far away.</p>
	<p class="indented"> We all but destroyed the Air temple and claimed the Sword of Air and the Censer of Air Elemental control.
		We were well-nigh killed due to staggering numbers of the enemy that set themselves against us. Magic was employed again
		and again by the enemies in the Air Elemental temple. I myself resisted several spells that threatened to do me harm. I
		fell victim to 2 spells, however, cast by the enemy. 1 made it difficult to hear, see and concentrate. The other struck
		my heart with such fear that I fled for a few moments before I gained composure. The 1st spell that harmed my perceptions
		seems to still be in effect. I think it might be a curse of some kind. I will speak to Rask in the morning about it. His
		magic I hope can remove the curse. While within the temple of Air I experienced my 2 big moments.</p>
	<p class="indented"> The 1st big moment came when I killed a woman in cold blood to protect the group and keep Tyro, the
		wild from getting any more "thirsty" for blood. The reasons were sound to me at first for doing such a dark thing. The
		2nd came when I was struck by the force wave of a Bead of Force thrown by Mewn. I will explain them in order.</p>
	<p class="indented"> 1st the Bead of Force big moment: The group was being overwhelmed. Enemies filled the room and more
		were coming from down a hall. We were outnumbered 3 to 1. It appeared hopeless until Mewn pulled out the Bead of Force.
		Mewn scanned the room and realized in a split second the blast would catch me. I nodded to her to throw the Bead. I knew
		it could kill me but using the Bead was our only real choice, I felt, at that moment. Mewn screamed my name and threw the
		small black Bead upon the floor. The burst from it shocked me to the bone and the enveloping force tried to contain me
		within a force bubble. I broke free of the enveloping force but was severely harmed. I yelled for Rask to get the other
		Bead of Force from my backpack. I wasn't sure he even understood me with the noise of battle but he did. Rask threw the
		second Bead into the hallway and a cacophony of force destroyed all the enemies in the hallway. Those that were struck
		by the Bead of Force inside the room were either killed or harmed like me. We survived the battle because of Mewn and Rask
		but it was in that moment I made the choice to be sacrificed if need be to save others.</p>
	<p class="indented"> The 2nd big moment came when I killed a woman in cold blood to conceal lies Quadro told, lies to help
		the group survive against deadly foes, about the death of this woman I killed. I smothered her to death to conceal the
		fact that we had not killed her in the battle. Quadro asked us as a group to kill her to protect his lies he told the master
		of the Temple of Air. Lies to buy us time to heal and get Grawl from Rastor. Tyro said he would kill her but I feared Tyro
		to be too "bloodthirsty" already so I spoke up choosing to kill, murder, her instead. Now the Question is what want I do
		to protect the group I adventure with. I killed in cold blood for the group and will, obviously, willingly die for same-said
		group.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> The master of the Air Temple escaped to spite our best efforts but not a single soldier, including
		the Air elemental beings summoned against us survived our attack. Strange thing is we destroyed the Air Temple while Tyro
		was gone to get Grawl in Rastor. When we felt at our lowest we attacked, at the order of Quadro, to save Mewn from a certain
		death since she was made invisible to kill Kallial in the throne room at The Air Temple with numerous guards, Clerics and
		the like in attendance. Things went badly for us for awhile but slowly we gained the upperhand and defeated our foes. Mewn
		survived several attempts to kill her while she was the victim of a hold person spell. Mewn would not die and this confounded
		the enemies and gave Quadro time to save an unconscious Mewn from being slain by advancing enemies. After getting Mewn
		back on her feet Quadro rejoined the fight with Mewn just behind, from there we won the battle.</p>

			<h2>Entry Eight</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> I learned that the wrong end of a Hydra is any end that is not completely dead. We battled an 8-headed
		dragon like monster Julin called a Hydra. I don't care to ever fight another creature like that again. The Hydra nearly
		killed me and if not for Menyoh I might have died. Tyro was also nearly slain before the creature was killed. The Hydra
		is not what is distressing me however. Menyoh deciding to adventure with us and how Rask is acting are the distressing
		things. A creature or enemy can fell any one of us but having a loved one on the trip is another story. The same goes for
		Rask and his attitude, his attitude is another story too, of take pity and feel sorry for me. Let me first deal with Menyoh.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Menyoh Daerkwood showed up in Rastor and told me she would be coming with us to adventure. I did not
		want her to go but after some discussion Menyoh was allowed to join at the behest of Quadro. I will never forget you for
		that Quadro, thank-you. Menyoh wants to be with me as badly as I do with her. But I felt she could not meet the challenges
		that we would face. I have thus far been wrong and by Rao may I continue to be incorrect. Menyoh has proven herself enough
		to get the vote of Mewn. This pleases me greatly though I am careful to show such emotion. I don't want Menyoh to let her
		guard down. I know as long as she believes she has to prove herself to me that she will be ever careful and as exacting
		as possible. Menyoh joining us has given me fresh reserve to continue battling the forces of evil within the temple. I
		have my wife and my comrades with me and I feel nothing can beat us now. My love for Menyoh has grown, if that is possible
		to have happen, though I thought I loved her as much as one could love another my heart sings anew and with deeper conviction.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Speaking of conviction. I am of a particular conviction that Rask might need to leave the group if
		he keeps on making threats whenever something does not go as he sees fit for it to go. Rask needs to learn that sometimes
		doing nothing is the best thing that can be done. Tenzanier told me once: "To do nothing when something must be done is
		wrong but doing something even if it is wrong is worse still."</p>
	<p class="indented">Some objects that had spells put upon them charmed Julin and Quadro and thus Quadro and Julin wanted
		to protect the objects from theft. Rask tried to take the objects even after Julin attacked Quadro for taking one of the
		objects, this if before Quadro got charmed, from the alter. Quadro and Julin wrestled Rask to the ground and took away
		the object. Rask started verbally attacking those of us that did not help him when he called for help. I explained my reasoning,
		no one was getting badly hurt and Quadro and Julin where not making their own judgements, that Quadro and Julin were not
		making their own decisions in the matter but rather the charm-spell was making it for them. Rask did not agree and became
		angry and threatened not to help us if one of us was in trouble. I told Rask that he would leave the group if he acted
		like that and did not help us when it was warranted. Rask then asked me if he went for one of the objects again would I
		support such a move. Julin and Quadro were still charmed so I told Rask such a decision was completely up to him. Rask
		quickly went pell-mell for another object. This is when something amazing occurred. Rask was polymorphed, a permanent effect,
		into a Dwarf.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> Rask is now a Dwarf but in the moment that I realized it happened I heard Menyoh and Mewn scream then
		noticing no danger and seeing that the Dwarfized Rask was the object of fright I laughed out loud for the first time in
		6 years. I realized the only time I ever laughed like that was around Menyoh. Then it came to me that I have been terribly
		somber and reserved because I have been away from Menyoh. Menyoh you are the light that guides my soul to do great things
		to be better than I am. You warm my heart and give me strength beyond measure. Thank-you my love.</p>
	<p class="indented"> The prophecy Rask possesses might not actually have anything to do with him if he remains a Dwarf.
		I wonder if such a change from Rask being human to transforming into a Dwarf would change the prophecy. Or does the prophecy
		only seem to be about Rask. This is interesting to think of since prophecies are tricky and malleable and altogether strange
		lots with exceptions being the rules and every rule having some obscure exception. My mother explained prophetic works
		like this: "Create an abstract piece of art such as a painting that is objectified and quantified by each viewer and perhaps
		by each new viewing by the same observer. This is most like prophecy except prophecy is much less clear and altogether
		more nebulous.." Of course I am paraphrasing what my mother said while being, I hope, faithful in spirit concerning what
		she told me. Perhaps Rask would benefit from sessions with XioXoe and Kunu since they deal with obscure languages, prophetic
		works and magical text as a matter of course.</p>
	<p class="indented"> It seems all of us have something or someone to find. Rask must find the Elven vampire and destroy
		it and its minions. Mewn must find her mother and father or learn of their fate by some means. Quadro must continue working
		until he "earns" the love of a woman. Meepo searches for his place in the above world. Julin must find the one big payoff
		that makes him not only rich but also known through the land as a "legend" of sorts. Tyro needs find his heart, though
		he knows not that he has lost it, and learn compassion and I dare say how to love. Menyoh searches for her place in the
		heart of the Elf she loves, not knowing she has found it because the Elf has never told her so, and thusly her place in
		this world. So I am fortunate enough to travel with two souls that possess a heart of gold. One a Kobold the other a beautiful
		Elven woman. Then there is Numenarh, he searches for someone and for something. The something is time, that thing he once
		thought he had so much of and needed no more of forever-and-ever, and the wisdom to use it correctly. The someone he searches
		for can be found with a steel mirror or an inward thought and yet this someone remains unfound and unknown.</p>
	<p class="indented"> For all my understanding of whom I am and all my inner thoughts I find I am confounded by my own wishes,
		will and wants.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		Bad foreboding overpowers me. Things are going to change I can feel it. If we stay and fight the forces of evil, I believe,
		there will be loss. Death is coming for some of us and I know in my heart there is nothing I can do to prevent it because
		we must go on and going on means death. I don't know how I know this I just know.</p>
	<p class="indented"> To win sometimes you must die.. I heard Arkay say that to my father during a debate over wars and armies.
		My father smiled, he almost never did such a thing, and retorted: "No, sometimes one must die so that others might win
		or lose as the case may be.." Then Tenzanier added wagging his finger at Arkay. "Nothing is certain, not victory, defeat
		not death or life when war is the backdrop to any land. Those that die might be remembered but the living, those victorious,
		take the spoils, everyone else takes the bitter wound of defeat or the grave."</p>
	<p class="indented"> I wrote earlier that nothing could beat us, but as I sit quiet awaiting Quadro to decide on a course
		of action. And the assault on the Fire Temple to begin I am overwhelmed by a silent fear that I know cannot be read in
		my face or actions. I have practiced my entire life at not showing what I really feel, as deeply as I feel it, to others.
		I look at Menyoh and know that what I must do is put down this book and tell her how much I love her and kiss her deeply
		before we enter the doors that begins the Fire Temple. Nothing else matters but letting Menyoh know with passion what I
		feel.</p>

	</p>
	<p class="indented"> Mewn has been killed twice. Lance is dead, animals almost never return to the world once dead, so he
		is gone forever. Tyro isn't even going to try and bring Lance back. I know how he feels. What is the point anyway. Mewn
		returned to life once more and I am glad she is alive"again" but yet my heart is filled with darkness. When Julin, Rask
		and Mewn returned from the resurrection of Mewn they found Menyoh dead. I waited for them to return because leaving might
		just get others killed including myself and then Menyoh would be lying in the forest rotting with no one to find her and
		bury her and pay her respect. But upon return I found out that Julin had a letter written by Menyoh. The note told me she
		loved me but that she did not want to be returned to life. Menyoh told me to do what I must and---TO not even let death
		stop me---</p>
	<p class="indented"> I will not let death stop me Menyoh. We buried her in a temple of Moradin. Allfather is what Moradin
		is called and since he created the Dwarves it fits for the Dwarves to call him that. Wonder what Menyoh would think about
		being buried by magic in the temple of a Dwarven god. I don't know how to go on without her and I don't know how not to
		since I have been charged by my wife, by her dying words and wishes, to go on no matter the cost even if it is my own life.</p>
	<p class="indented"> A woman named Celeste is training me to suffuse magic into my bow and my arrows so that I might strike
		with arrows enhanced by arcane magics. I will learn to strike as never before and deal death more quickly. It is a means
		to an end and that end is the death of the denizens of The Temple of Elemental Evil and especially the Githyanki who killed
		Menyoh. The arts I am learning are showing me magic in a completely different way and thusly opening new ways to use the
		meager magic I can command for a greater purpose. I will learn more magic and delve into the arts and in them I shall seek
		a way to exact justice.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		I don't know what all this is for. I am stumbling in the dark searching for answers and all I keep doing is seeing those
		I care for and one I love with all my heart and soul die. I am no longer going to take prisoners, unless it helps my cause
		to do so, and those that I slay will be dismembered so it is harder to return them to life. What anyone else says about
		this being wrong or cruel is of no matter to me. It is the bitter wound of defeat or the grave and I intend it to be the
		grave for all those that I can manage to kill. And those that suffer defeat will know my wrath and warn of my coming unless
		they are fools. I will be known by name by these horrid men, monsters and beasts and they shall fear my coming but it will
		do them no good.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I will have to stop writing soon as I grow weary and the night sounds of Nyr-Dyv, near the lake, call
		for me to trance and to "dream" and so for awhile I can be at peace. After tonight I will again be seeking to slay and
		destroy, this is my goal and my life for now. I will write to Tenzanier and tell him that I shall not be coming home for
		a year or more. I will not mention Menyoh since I wish to tell her mother and father in person. She was my wife and is
		my love so the duty is mine alone and I will honor that duty as grim as it is to tell her family in person.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Mewn seems darker than ever and Julin has taken refuge with the Renee, hope I spelled that correctly
		Julin, on a small island. Quadro searches for magic and armor to better fight and defend us. Meepo is with me as he is
		a comfort that the world has some soft souls left within it. And Rask, again human, is praying at the temple and thinking
		of buying scrolls with his money. Tyro has a new companion in Luke. Luke is also a wolf and Tyro has made him dire as well.</p>
	<p class="indented"> My friends all need rest, as they are so beat down and weary. I and Mewn most of all are disheartened
		and I fear Mewn may be lost to us now. Perhaps this rest will renew them and give me a chance to devise a way to seek vengeance
		on my enemies. For now my mind is too weary to think of plans to rid the world of the evil we face but rather I think of
		the wonderful nights I spent with Menyoh in the Kron Hills by the lake and how I will never do that again. The sun will
		rise on my face but never again in my heart.</p>
		<hr/>
	<!-- <p class="indented">________________</p> -->
	<p class="indented"> I wrote once that I would talk about the wedding when I was more at ease with myself. I took the time
		to script our adventures as a group yet neglected to write into the journal the events of my wedding. I put it off because
		I was not in a mood to write of happy things and because I was tired. I have learned a deeply disturbing lesson that I
		thought I knew, from moment to moment no one knows where there life will lead or even if they will be alive, the life of
		an adventurer is even more chancy than the unpredictability that life lends to us all. Mortal danger, the group and I have
		chosen this life for whatever reason, is part and parcel of each day and night. I have lost so much now I can never get
		it back. I am an adventurer and this is my life. My inner voice speaks to me with new resolve and great conviction. I broke
		from my trance a few minutes ago and during my trance I came to understand with clarity that I must, for Menyoh, be a hero.
		Menyoh Daerkwood would want me to be a hero and make my life and her death count for something good and worthwhile. I will
		use my devotion to her memory to spur me on no matter how dark my life becomes. I will make your sacrifice count Menyoh
		and I will make you proud.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		Just before we attacked the Fire Temple I whispered to Menyoh that I loved her beyond words and wanted to have children with
		her when this was over. I told her she was my light in an ever-darkening place, a beacon to my soul to remain true to who
		I am and the Elf I want my children to know me as. She smiled and cried and then she told me: "And I want you to know you
		have always been a hero to me and now you must be a hero in this group, a hero among heroes. Be a hero Numenarh it is who
		you truly are my love."</p>
	<p class="indented"> I did not know this would be our last conversation but the things we chose to say let me know Menyoh
		did not die without knowing how much I care for her and love her in all ways. And know now she feels I have the mark of
		a hero and so I open my heart to being a hero. I shall become my loves last spoken wish before dying.</p>

	<p class="indented"> Meepo was killed. Rask raised Meepo from the dead. Still Meepo died and the enemy we have been battling
		was responsible. The leader of the air temple was trying to recruit troops in Dyvers. The recruiting process did not go
		well however since we killed most all his new troops and in fact managed to slay the air temple leader himself.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I was able to track some enemies down river. I chose to go alone to stay focused and because humans
		and Dwarves need sleep and Elves simply don't sleep. We trance for 4 hours, and so can work with little rest. I found a
		warehouse and a door in the floor that was well hidden. This tracking effort took hours but I returned, meditated and was
		ready to go when the rest of our group was ready to leave. We battled some enemies at magical darkness was used against
		us again. An explosive blast burned up the floor causing Julin and Meepo to fall through the burning floor. Quadro barley
		escaped the fall and Mewn and I used a door in the floor to escape the blaze. This is how Meepo died. But our adventures
		are not what I want to write of, not exactly. I more want to speak of the conversation Quadro and I had in private and
		the direction I think Mewn is going in her life. And lastly I will write about my own feelings about remaining with the
		group.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I told Quadro something deeply personal and also told him that I saw Mewn kill "in cold blood" an incapacitated
		enemy. Quadro did not seem to care; Quadro did not care actually, about what Mewn did. I was fine with it for a few moments
		and then I started thinking and I realized it was wrong to kill like that. Quadro says it goes to the greater good and
		so to better benefit the world killing some very evil individuals no matter how it is done is okay. Or at least killing
		them when they cannot defend themselves is okay to Quadro and I think fine with Mewn too. I don't know what everyone else
		feels but I will be calling their beliefs into question as well Mewn and Quadro will be asked what they feel in front of
		the rest of the group.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> I have to ask everyone what he or she feels about killing the defenseless even if they are evil and
		vile and trying to destroy the world. I have my own dark thoughts as well that must be dealt with.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Mewn exhibits a "It no longer matters" attitude where killing and I am afraid being killed is concerned.
		She has been returned to life 3 times.. Each time she is returned from the dead Mewn becomes less like the Mewn we met
		in the tavern and more like a stranger to me. I see the changes. I notice so much more than the others do about Mewn or
		for that matter anyone in the group. My vision is clear concerning the attitudes of the group and what will be said of
		the questions I will ask.. I can predict what will be said. I thought I did not know I see now that I do know what each
		will say or believe. Julin and Meepo will be against the killing of the defenseless evils. Rask will grudgingly agree after
		some efforts by Mewn and me. Tyro, the wild is "uncaring" enough to be swayed that it is for the best to kill the evil
		beings as easily as I might blink my eyes at any given moment. Quadro will either stand by what he told me in the hall
		in private during our talk or he will change his tune. I think he will not change his tune about killing incapacitated
		foes. But if Quadro does then I will speak with him again alone and we will come to agreement on things.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I lost my wife and when that happened I felt true loss for the first time ever that I have lived. The
		feeling was dark and empty and yet filled with bitter cold rage and a deep sinking feeling. The sinking feeling haunts
		me still just as the cold heartedness I carry weighs me down. I spoke to Quadro about my trepidation. Quadro told me, in
		so many words, it was okay to hate the terrible beings of The Temple of Elemental Evil and it was just as fine to kill
		them to prevent the end of the world or at best terrible wars. Many innocent people would die during wars waged against
		a powerful army of The Temple of Elemental Evil and so if evil grows strong the innocent suffers. If their dark god escapes
		his prison the world suffers. The only answer is to fight fire with fire. To wage unforgiving war upon those that will
		not forgive. To destroy forever those that wish destruction upon all good folk is what is called for during this dark time.
		I cannot see another way as I sit here writing and looking at Quadro, Mewn, Julin, Rask and Meepo and Tyro. No other way
		but to become a horror to horrors. Quadro has told me he trust me and that I am the least impulsive and most careful of
		the group. I find this to be wrong. I let my wife go to a place of overwhelming evil and she was slain. I could not save
		Menyoh from the horror that befell her. I can never make my bad judgement or their heinous acts right but I can work to
		do my best and never let such feelings cloud my thinking again. Love and caring and a sense of well being when I was with
		Menyoh made me forget the perils we face and in forgetting I lost my one true love. For this I will repay the forces of
		The Temple of Elemental Evil and all those that shelter them or voice their cause. They will pay for what they have done.
		They shall pay with their dearest blood.

	<p class="indented">To put a fine point on it Julin saved us all. We found some members of the water temple and engaged
		them. The battle was going very well until some clerics did a cooperative spell and brewed up some sort of lightning magic
		that struck us terrible blows. If this were not bad enough the minions of the water temple called out and two large lobster
		like creatures lumbered toward us, summoned by the call of the amphibious humanoids of the water temple, and began attacking
		with their powerful pincers. The lobster like creatures could paralyze with their tentacles and I found that their strength
		was far greater than I could hope to overcome. I was snatched up and held by one of the creatures. I could not get free.
		Quadro and Rask fell victim to the paralyzing tentacles and Mewn was captured by a hold person spell of the lightning brewing
		clerics. Meepo was hurt badly and Tyro was dismayed at the death of Luke. With nearly the whole group hindered or simply
		removed from doing anything via paralysis or spell it was Julin who used his magic to turn the tide in our favor.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Julin struck out with thunderous sound using his magic to crush one of the lobster creatures that held
		me. This act saved my life. I was able to strike out at the lightning brewing clerics and harmed mortally one of them.
		Julin hurled more sound into the downed cleric because we had seen twice before that one or the other cleric healed the
		one we felled and again threatened us with spells. Those clerics made a frightening team but in the end they could not
		stand against Julin and his sonic attacks. With luck and the exhaustive bravery of Julin we survived. I survived. As I
		said Luke, the companion of Tyro was slain. Tyro used his magic to reincarnate Luke after the battle. Luke was reincarnated
		as a human. Luke being human now was naked and it had not mattered that Luke had no clothes when a wolf but as a man it
		did matter. Julin gave Luke a robe to wear in order to maintain modesty. I knew humans were hairy but I had no idea they
		were so laden with hair as they are. How uncomfortable all the hair must be.</p>
	<p class="indented"> We have faced many threats while inside the temple and I never know what might attack next. I have
		been writing that I will take vengeance upon my enemies and slaughter them and that the evil beings will know my name,
		yet I never commit. I don't know what is wrong that I do not take the actions I write about. I did not write about my wedding
		and now there is no point. I did not prove to my father I could live my life without magic, this I failed at entirely,
		since I am using magic Quadro taught me and adding magic to my arrows with the arcane arts taught me by Celeste. I did
		not stay and make Rastor a better place - I left that to Grawl. I have not done many things I profess I will do.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Quadro says I am the most level headed and clear thinking and careful of the group but what they don't
		know is I am driven by hate and consumed by fear. I have all these inner demons that have awakened in me. The world is
		a scary place to me now. I am weary of the evils of this world and weary of the world itself. In fact, for me, the world
		has ended as far as I am concerned. All I have left is the pursuit of destruction of the denizens of The Temple of Elemental
		Evil. The evils of that place ended my world and I will be a part of ending their world for them. To save a world I no
		longer belong in or care to belong to must surely mean I either have a deeper purpose of good and am following that or
		perhaps it means I am losing myself in malice and hate. Perhaps all the emotions I have left, those that drive my existence
		anyway are at their core rotten. Quadro is rousing and Meepo is already awake______I will have to finish this entry another
		time.. Now I must go to war.</p>

			<h2>Entry Twelve</h2>
			<p class="indented">
				I have been through horrific times since I met Julin Quadro, Rask, Tyro, Meepo, Mewn, Grawl and Barkin. In all that time
				it seems only Barkin and Grawl had the sense to quit before what they faced changed them forever. I have been changed,
				so has Mewn, into something wholly other than what we were when we began fighting The Temple of Elemental Evil. The others
				have changed too. Julin is more aggressive and Quadro has blended techniques of magic and fighting style, as I have never
				seen before. Quadro has managed through necessity to mesh arcane magic with axe and armor. Meepo has learned some unique
				magic through intuition and self-discovery. Rask has come to terms with the prophecy being close to culmination. The
				fellow who gave Rask the prophecy resurrected Rask and told him that the time to face the Elven-vampire was at hand.
				Rask was taught some techniques and told some things but I don't know how they will help him against centuries old evil.
				Rask seems confident now as never before that he can defeat the Elven-vampire. I am not so sure such a thing can be defeated
				by him but I am not Rask nor am I a part of the prophecy he is written into.

	</p>
	<p class="indented"> Large creatures able to make sound that can sheer stone and pulverize nearly anything attacked us.
		In the battle these completely blind creatures managed to unerringly seek out and strike telling blows, as we stood helpless
		in the pitch black of the cavern that was their home. First Julin fell and then Meepo. I called for a retreat and grabbed
		Julin from the unforgiving ground he'd been slammed into by the sonic breath weapon of the terrible creatures that with
		ease were becoming our undoing. Quadro said he thought we could defeat them and in the meager light of the continual flame
		ring I wear I saw his face and knew Quadro would not retreat. Quadro, Tyro and Mewn formulated a plan to kill the creatures
		but of them the most foolish by far was Tyro, the wild. Tyro and his wolf raced to battle the beasts and confronted the
		creatures head-on. It was but moments before Luke and Tyro was slain. By this time I managed to get Julin out into the
		hall and through a door the monsters could not fit through - I hoped, as far as I could figure. Our swan song was begun.
		Quadro fell and lay dying and I could do nothing but watch by the pale light of my wedding ring. Mewn still stood; I could
		hear her, yet I could not see her. For some reason as I have yet to guess Quadro, before being struck down, cast invisibility
		on Mewn. The creatures being "blind" were nonplused by such a useless effort to escape detection.</p>
	<p class="indented"> _____________ -____-- -___________ I ordered Mewn to save Quadro since he was our leader.
		Mewn saved Quadro and then saved Meepo as well. I ordered Mewn to close the door to the expansive cavern that was the creature's
		lair but then a blast of sonic energy struck me and I fell to the ground unable to do anything more. I was unable to help
		Mewn close the door. I don't know what happened from there, well not for awhile I didn't.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I lay between dying and living for hours before I roused awake. I awoke Julin, Meepo and Quadro. I
		still felt that my life was "thinner" than it should be but I knew I would live. Mewn was no place to be found and after
		tracing her footsteps and finding the sword of Air lying at the door I knew what had happened. The creature though quite
		large had been able to reach through the open iron door and drag Mewn away. My order had been her death and her blood I
		must accept as on my hands"yet"</p>
	<p class="indented">
		I looked at Quadro and repeated some of the words he'd used to keep me in the group when I told Quadro my heart was growing
		dark. "Numenarh you are the least impulsive, most careful of the group and I trust your judgement most of all.." That is
		very close to what Quadro told me in private and I spoke his words back to him in frustration and anger. I yelled for retreat
		and in all the time Quadro had known me I had never done such a thing. Quadro did not listen and instead gave hope of defeating
		the beasts that were already crafting our doom.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Rask, Tyro, Luke, and Mewn were dead and to be sure of what was their fate Julin recalled tale on Mewn.
		Julin described in grizzly detail how the monsters devoured our friends. Quadro admitted he'd made a mistake but admitting
		it did not get our friends back from the dead. Without a body the steep price of True resurrection would be impossible
		for us given the meager resources at hand. We would have to sell everything we had to true resurrect our friends. Just
		as things were the most bleak I had known them since the death of my wife Julin proposed something rather daring and possibly
		suicidal. Take Tulian's eye to a temple of Moradin and ask for our friends to be resurrected in "exchange" for Tulian's
		eye. Of course a deadly curse lay upon the diamond involving a wasting disease to any whom removed it from the resting-place
		it'd been given. I volunteered to be afflicted but Quadro spoke up and said he would carry the eye and that he would bare
		whatever curse lay upon the diamond. I did not argue with him.</p>
	<p class="indented"> The Dwarves received us readily and were ecstatic to have the diamond returned to them. We were given
		hot meals and many thanks. In the bargain, as well, our friends were returned to life, except for Tyro and Luke. Tyro,
		the wild did not return when called from the afterlife and since Tyro would have the say in what to do about his dead companion
		Luke remained among the dead as well. All together again save one.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I was born on the first day of Patchwall and my birthday passed almost uneventfully. Mewn gave me a
		figurine that was a likeness of both Mewn and Menyoh. The figurines were holding hands and both managed to appear to be
		looking up at me. An inscription read that I would never be alone but the gift made me feel the most alone as I ever have
		that I can remember in 117 years. I have great warmth for Mewn for giving me the gift and know the purpose was completely
		for the purpose of making me happy on my day of birth. But I felt coldly alone because Menyoh is gone forever and I don't
		know when Mewn might die and like Tyro never return to the world of the living. Tyro died and the spell to resurrect him
		was unsuccessful. What makes Mewn different than Tyro and why did Tyro not return. After the death of Tyro, the wild the
		group met Drak. Drak is a druid like Tyro but has a bear instead of a wolf as a companion. Drak healed Mewn when she was
		badly hurt so I instantly trusted Drak on the basis he healed someone without question.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I have decided to write my father and tell him of the death of Menyoh Daerkwood. I will write a separate
		letter to the family of Menyoh about how sorry I am about the death of their daughter. I have to accept what happened to
		me and my love and get real closure involving her death. This is the only way I can be a whole person again, be Numenarh
		or at least not be a brooding and lonely Elf. Hopefully after all this that has and will happen I can be the Numenarh of
		old. Mewn and the rest of the group help me feel I can go on but if I don't get out of this destructive mood and deal with
		the loss of Menyoh in earnest I feel I might become cold hearted or worse. So I will deal with her death and learn to deal
		with my new life and the life I will live after we beat the living nine-hells out the Doomdreamers and all their horde
		of horrors. Numenarh Daerkwood__________

			<h2>Entry Thirteen</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> I begin this entry just after having reread all the other entries before this one. I have learned something
		and it came at a time, as many things do these days, when I least expected it. What I have learned about myself is the
		beginning of the end of the darkness I harbor in my heart. I have fumed at the evil temple dwellers and wished death and
		doom to them and the creatures that inhabit the temple areas. I have not simply wanted justice or to save lives I have
		wanted to bring them pain and suffering and wanted to be more like them than like whom I really am. I forgot the kind of
		Elf I am and the kind of upbringing I received. I forgot who Numenarh Daerkwood is and for some time began acting unlike
		myself. No one noticed for some while because I am stoic and standoffish by nature, but even I could not hide the darkness
		in my heart. We were battling Salamanders and in the battle the creatures used fiery swords, their swords are aflame apparently
		only while they hold them, and cunning tactics to confuse us. In the battle Rask was slain. I killed the Salamander that
		slew him but I felt horrible for not being able to save him from dying. I was standing beside Rask and he was killed and
		I could not prevent it. This caused a terrible shadow in my soul. I knew it would take weeks to go back to Nyr Dyv to have
		Rask true resurrected and I also knew Rask had been saving coin to buy magical items to battle the Elven vampire the prophecy
		speaks of. I knew Tyro was dead and never was going to rejoin us so I said we should use Tyro's money to Resurrect Rask
		and save Rask the currency he'd been saving. This is not what we agreed to when our group was first formed. Julin became
		upset with me and Quadro agreed I was wrong in wanting to use the money Tyro left behind to pay for Rask and let Rask keep
		his coins. With Rask dead and endangering us all I began to act in an irate manner. Or more to the point far worse than
		Rask. Actually my behavior was childish, dangerous and a display of near utter madness. In writing now I should not even
		compare it to Rask, especially since Rask has improved his ways a great deal and his attitude with it. I threatened my
		friends and snapped at Mewn for no reason and these are but a small number of things I did to provoke arguments and challenge
		the group. In the end I broke down because I realized suddenly what has been wrong with me. I have been dark-minded and
		filled with such rage and sitting on the floor sobbing I came to a stunning conclusion.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I hate you Menyoh Daerkwood. My hatred and anger at you Menyoh has given me my dark attitudes. And
		not admitting it brought me to my knees. Only after I broke down did I realize what I had been denying all this time. I
		denied that your death wounded me so and I denied that your letter you wrote and gave in secret to Julin wounded me. I
		denied that I felt cold anger that you professed to love me so very much but would not return to me after your death. So
		many people do not have the resources to bring back a loved one whom has been lost. It is well within my bounds to have
		returned you to life Menyoh and yet in your letter you tell me to go on without you. You tell me to not let death stop
		me but to continue on no matter what even though you choose to remain lost to me.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I could not fathom why you chose to write a letter in secret to Julin explaining your choice not to
		be raised from the dead and why you could not have the mettle to tell me yourself. I will never know I suppose. I bravely
		went on after your death and pretended I was not overwhelmed with guilt and loss at your death. So many things have happened
		to me since I left the Kron Hills and I know so many more things both joyful and grim will happen to me as I go about my
		life. Considering the choices I have made I hope the joy will outstretch the grim but I have doubt my life will be as good.
		But even if many things are hard and painful for me, and our group, I know that protecting the innocent and thwarting evil
		such as we have battled is for a greater purpose. I am a hero Menyoh and I am going to start acting like one. I have changed
		so much and learned so many things about evil and horrors to chill the marrow that I cannot in good conscious let such
		horror stand in the world.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		I have learned things about courage and friendship and the very meaning of good has been redefined in my mind. I will strive
		to best the foes of darkness wherever they may be. When the foes of the Temple are beaten and the Doomdreamers thrown down
		I will continue to seek out evil and evildoers in other places. I feel it is my duty and my calling to walk the land and
		help those that cannot help themselves. I will return to Rastor as well and make good on my promise to bring law and order
		to Rastor. I will never again ignore the purpose I am born for.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Menyoh I am still angry you did not return to me. But now I can heal and after some time I know I can
		let go of the pain and anguish and eventually the guilt I feel for not being able to somehow save you. I only hope Julin
		and the others can forgive me for my actions and words_______</p>
	<p class="indented"> I will be looking forward to each day now where just a short while ago before my revelation I dreaded
		each new day. I feel like I am a part of the world again, my hopes in life are toward the future, and as such I will protect
		what I am part of from the Doomdreamers and their hordes of evil.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I was at the lowest point in all my life and feeling like, at that time, I could not go on living.
		I wanted to give up and die. Then I heard Mewn use Zephyr and I heard loud clanging of metal on metal. I arose and moved
		to help Mewn. The rest of the group came to her aid as well. We entered a room of utter horror. Hanging on hooks and other
		impaling devices were the decaying bodies of several different races. Some of the flesh had been torn away or removed and
		some flesh remained. The bodies were mutilated and it was obvious hours of torture went on in the room. In the room where
		such carnage was committed, with glee, a bloody bed sat silently as a testament that the being responsible for the butchery
		also slept in the room. Julin recalled tale and discovered a Gnome was responsible for the debauchery. A badly wounded
		and tortured person was found in the room as well. I gave him a healing potion and we used the healing wand on him as well.
		Panicked and afraid at first he eventually realized we were not here to harm him and accepted our help. After the sickening
		room and the magic that helped us determine who had committed such violent acts we all agreed to hunt down the Gnome and
		slay him. Julin even hinted to the tortured man that we would torture and dismember the Gnome. I doubt we will but in this
		case I think it is justified.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		As I write I find that I have only 8 pages left after this one. I have all but filled up this little journal book. So when
		next I reach another place to purchase another journal book I will. I bought a small "diary" in the beginning because I
		thought I would have few things to write about. Or I believed interest would wane in keeping a journal and it would be
		forgotten. All the opposite. I find I need a new and larger book to keep my writings and I have many things to write about.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		Quadro and Mewn look impatient and I can hear Quadro making plans, discussing things with Julin, Mewn is being ordered to
		scout. Onward</p>

			<h2>Entry: Fouteen</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> I am near the end of this book and only at the beginning, I fear, of dealings with the Temple of Elemental
		evil. For the first time since we have battled them I feel today we dealt them a telling blow. Even when the Air Temple
		was destroyed and the air Sword captured I didn't feel like much had been done. I am glad we survived and we could continue
		on and I know we hurt the forces of the temple but I did not feel we taxed them enough for their plans to be halted. Today
		was different. A powerful set of individuals was sent to destroy us including a beast called a Grey Render. The Render
		was magically enhanced with glyphs and runes and it flashed with magic during the battle. Quadro and Nox, someone I have
		never mentioned before now I realize, took on the Grey Render. Nox is a Githzaeri and he and Vit also Githzaeri have been
		helping us as of late do battle with the Temple. The Gith have come to see if the threat is warranted and since they quickly
		learned the temple is very threatening Vit returned to his home and Nox remained to gather more information and along the
		way help us. The Grey Render attacked furiously and that combined with a fireball and Flamestrike thrown at us taxed us
		to our brink. The battle was going hopelessly against us so we decided to retreat, when we saw we could not get away however
		it became fight and win or fight and die. We made a choice___________</p>
	<p class="indented"> Quadro and I could have escaped and left everyone else to their own devices but this is not what happened.
		Quadro said it looked like we were going to have to reengage the enemy. Meepo was cut off from escape and Mewn against
		orders chose to continue fighting. So Quadro and I entered the fray once more hoping to turn the tide and win the day.
		Quadro went after the Grey Render and I came in close to deal with the spellcasters. My arrows struck true and just as
		I was about to reposition myself and fire more arrows I heard Quadro exclaim: "Die you big gray bastard." The magical hammer
		Quadro held struck a terrific blow against the Render. A moment after the creature recoiled from the hammer's blow Nox
		struck out with a furious onslaught using only his fist. The rapid snapping sounds let me know Nox was doing serious damage.
		The Render as big and as magically enhanced as it was swayed and stumbled. The Render touched a glyph and healing energy
		knitted its wounds then it touched another glyph and it was all but completely healed. Seeing this I let 2 arrows fly and
		both struck the Render, 1 struck the arm the other landed in its side, angering it. I wasn't sure I helped them or just
		enraged the huge beast. Nox and Quadro in tandem struck from each side of the beast confusing it and in the end all the
		Render could do before Quadro and Nox ended its life was sway and stumble to the symphony of hammer and fist. The beast
		fell dead. </p>
	<p class="indented"> As Quadro and Nox was battling the Render, before it died of course, other things were happening. Mewn
		managed to get trapped and Meepo was on the ground but still alive. I let fly 3 arrows and felled 3 guards but I could
		tell the guards were only there to die, run interference for the Clerics, so devastating spells could be cast against us
		unanswered. So much for the interference, I smile. Mewn pulled the bead of force from her pouch and throws it. The bead
		harms many of our enemies and encapsulates one in a bubble of force. The force blast of the bead of force sent shock waves
		through an already unconscious Meepo. The blast killed Meepo. I hurled my bead of force as well. 2 More enemies were encapsulated
		and others fell to the second shock wave. Quadro and Nox by this time had wailed upon the Gray Render sending it crashing
		to the floor, dead. From here on the battle went our way. Nox used magic to shatter the armor of an enemy soldier and Mewn
		kept attacking with Zephyr, her sword of air, to full effect and in the end with song, arrow, metal and magic we took victory
		from the jaws of defeat. We now own the Sword of fire. We have the enemies guessing. They sent a Grey Render, a half-fiend,
		soldiers and several Clerics with magical enhancements on them I have never seen wielding 5th level spells and none of
		them will return to report to their superiors. They don't know what we are capable of and I am sure they sent this entourage
		to quash us and yet it is they whom are quashed.</p>
	<p class="indented"> We have made the decision to return to Verbobonc but I will stay in Rastor with Nox and someone new
		who may join us in the fight against the Doomdreamers.</p>
	<p class="indented"> The person I speak of now that I am in Rastor is Malicai. He is a sorcerer and proud of it. Malicai
		talks almost constantly. I noticed that he also keeps calling my name out as if I am across the road. "Numenarh!" Or "Hey,
		Numenarh." This in fact is going on now while I am writing in my book. I decided to buy a journal here in Rastor but they
		don't have anything suitable so I will have to wait till later to get a new journal. I wish I had________ Malicai challenged
		me to an archery contest and at the moment I don't have my bow. Quadro took my bow and my rapier to Verbobonc so he could
		enchant them. Malicai is calling again saying something about getting an ale. Malicai has gone off to get a drink.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Mewn found Malicai while she was scouting. Malicai was beaten up and chained to a wall and Mewn set
		him free. I shall have to talk to her about that later. But on a more serious note Mewn told me she has been feeling strange.
		I really wish I had gone to Verbobonc since Nox is not much company and Malicai is way too much.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Malicai is offering that we both go get a drink apparently he never made it to the tavern. I will go
		with him and finish my journal another time. _____________</p>
	<p class="indented"> The trip to the tavern was event filled. Malicai decided that a random Orc had attacked him and caused
		him to be imprisoned where Mewn found him. Malicai knocked this Orc out and nearly killed him. I arrested Malicai for this
		and he ended up being a prisoner in the jail I helped build in Rastor. The Orc survived and Malicai only need stay 2 days
		in jail since I gave the Orc 12 gold for his injuries and trouble. The Orc luckily seemed fine with the outcome. I would
		have demanded more but I guess this particular Orc did not care to get too involved with the whole legal side of it. Since
		no permanent harm was done to him I guess he just wanted to get away from Malicai and enjoy the rest of his day. In fact
		with Malicai in jail I will go for a long walk in the woods.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Malicai is out of jail now and he keeps asking if we can go to Verbobonc. I keep saying no and he keeps
		asking.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> I am writing the rest of this in Verbobonc. I did not go to Verbobonc because Malicai kept asking and
		asking to go. I went to Verbobonc because Julin contacted me through magic to tell me that Quadro had been arrested for
		murder and Mewn was wanted for murder and I should Teleport to Verbobonc. He suggested the magic shop owner of Rastor might
		have a scroll or Teleportation. I was able to get a scroll for free due to a fortunate bit of luck. A young man whom had
		been tortured by the evil Gnome we still have yet to slay is someone the magic shop owner cares about. I got the scroll
		for free. I was not sure I could cast it properly and even though I knew Malicai could do it with ease I attempted it because
		I don't trust Malicai. I took Nox and Malicai with me. I was able to magically send us all to a holy temple in Verbobonc.
		I felt very good about myself for accomplishing such a difficult spell. Once in Verbobonc I found that Quadro had killed
		2 people trying to help Mewn escape from guards whom wanted Mewn for murder. I tried to get Quadro out of jail but the
		officials would have none of it. They wanted him in jail. The magic shop owner vouched for Quadro however saying that he
		had put a Dominate Person spell on Quadro and could control him almost like a puppet. I didn't care for this but it got
		Quadro out of prison and able to help me track Mewn.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Mewn had turned evil because of a cursed stone she'd been carrying around. She told me she'd been hearing
		voices and I told her that if she started not feeling like herself to tell me. She did not tell me she was feeling like
		a cold-blooded murderer so I am hoping she misunderstood not feeling like herself. I chose not to go into the particulars
		of it but we tracked down Mewn and jailed her for her crime.</p>
	<p class="indented"> It was discovered that the magical stone cursed Mewn and Malicai said if we broke it that it might
		set her free of the evil and allow her to be Mewn again. Malicai was correct. The ordeal was devastating to Mewn and she
		broke down in tears. I stayed in her jail cell all night to comfort her. Nox stayed by our side as well. I am beginning
		to trust him as much as I do Quadro or Julin. I have not figured out if Nox or Meepo gets stranger looks but I think Nox
		does if I had to hazard a guess.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		Rask purchased Raise Dead scrolls and returned both guards Quadro killed to the living. That and it came to light Quadro
		was trying to stop and hinder the guards and not willfully kill them. Mewn was found to be incompetent at the time of the
		murder since a cursed stone drove her to become evil and ultimately kill. Because of Rask and a little forgiveness on the
		part of the guards and lots of explaining Quadro and Mewn were set free. Quadro was released much more reluctantly than
		Mewn yet still the authorities let him go.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I let Mewn read my Journal so she would know how I feel about some things. I think she needs that connection.
		Mewn needs to know this ongoing battle with evil is and has been hard on me too and if she sees what I write and how I
		feel on paper it will be more real to her. She allowed me to read her journal as well. I think she might like Julin a little
		more than as a friend or at least she is, perhaps, open to possibly getting to know Julin better. Mewn has a fondness for
		me I did not know she had either. I think she sees me as a brother or very close friend. Quadro says we will be staying
		in Verbobonc for a little while so I will scribe the Mage Armor scroll into my spellbook.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Malicai challenged me to a "duel" by striking me with a glove across the face. He says I insulted him
		and his honor. Human beings are strange creatures or more correctly this human being is quite strange. Malicai walked about
		40 feet from me and started to cast a spell so I shot him. His spell was thwarted by my attack. The magical energies started
		to take form and then the magic fell apart in a small glowing shower of sparks. Malicai badly wounded swore: "You will
		see me again some day Numenarh you can count on it." When he said that I had a moment of hesitation where I wanted to finish
		him off before he skulked into the darkness. I almost fired but did not take the opportunity to kill Malicai since he was
		defenseless and fleeing, as best he could, from me. The reason I hesitated and considered attacking him was I know Malicai
		is a sorcerer and a Dragon disciple. This means he will after a time take on many characteristics of a particular type
		of dragon. I told Malicai during our stay in Rastor that I lived in the Kron hills and even the town my family resides.
		But I can't think of his parting threat now. Soon we will reengage our most lethal enemies. Quadro enchanted my bow with
		shock and made my rapier magical also.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I have come to the end of this journal and so the next time I write it will be in the new journal I
		have purchased here in Verbobonc. So few words written to tell such a grand and terrible tale. No one will ever know what
		we have been through and what we have faced except those of us who have been in it from the beginning. Those of us who
		began at the Sunless Citadel know most of all how much the other has endured and overcome and how very much some of us
		have lost. But each of us has also gained things. Strength, courage, knowledge, magic, insight and greatest of all trust.
		</p>
	<p class="indented"> Quadro, Meepo, Julin, Rask and Mewn these people whom I have been with from the onset are the ones
		I consider the group. They are the ones I consider above my own life. We are as family in my mind. Since the battle involving
		the Gray Render and the ordeal of returning Mewn to whom she truly is I have begun to change how I feel and think about
		the group. I feel more at home in the company of the group than any place I have ever been. </p>
	<p class="indented">Quadro is the armored spellcaster who is always looking to find a way to be just that one bit more armored.
		By spell or item or battle technique he searches to thwart or escape the attacks of his enemies. Julin is the helper and
		the voice of reason, sometimes, when things get particularly bad. His attacks are quick and sure and he is the true diplomat
		and most always the face of the party. Especially if we need to sell something or get information. Meepo is the heart of
		gold and the trusting soul but with a harder edge. Meepo has gained so much magical insight I can hardly believe it is
		still Meepo sometimes. Mewn is the scout and our stealthy attacker. She is excellent at attacking from a distance and in
		ways or from directions the enemy cannot guess. She is the wild card of the group. Sometimes effective and deadly and sometimes
		not as much. She has an undertow sense of humor be it dark at times it still befits her wily personality. She still possesses
		the mindset of a human being and this is in part her charm. It certainly is where her wit comes from. Humans have savvy
		I have found and a willingness to learn anything that might help them no matter the cost or time needed to put into the
		work. Mewn often learns things with lightning speed and in this she is more like a human as well. Humans rush about learning
		multitudes of things faster than Elves do and all at once as well it would seem. Then there is Rask. He is the healer and
		a fighter. Rask has grown to be able to strike with death dealing effect. His healing magic has grown to match his destructive
		powers. Rask has grown as a person and with all the changes it is hard to figure what he might accomplish next but whatever
		it might be I am sure it will be devastating to the enemies or a great boon to us as a group.</p>

			<h2>Entry Fifteen</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> I don't have a lot of time to write but I felt I should put down how I feel while I still feel the
		way I do, as strongly as I do, about the death of Julin. Julin, Mewn and Drak had all been hurt badly by undead Specters
		and Shadows that attacked us without mercy. Rask drove may of them away by channeling the power of his deity thorough a
		holy symbol and I managed to destroy 2 but it was Julin, Quadro and Rask who did the most to defeat the horde of undead
		creatures that nearly took our lives. Without Rask I doubt Julin, Drak or Mewn would have survived that battle in the coffin
		room. I am not sure any of us would have lived. The toll the undead dealt us contributed to how Julin would die and what
		Quadro had turned him into..</p>
	<p class="indented">
		Julin was sick with weakness so Quadro polymorphed Julin into a Minotaur. It was the only way to keep Julin on his feet.
		Not long after the battle in the coffin room we came upon a huge magical circle that clearly was very powerful and after
		some divination spells we discovered the circle, scribed with sigils and glyphs, held conjuration magic. Conjuration magic
		summons things or brings things into being and so a circle such as this would probably summon something. Quadro took it
		upon himself to step into the circle to see what would happen. 2 huge spider-like creatures with razorish forelimbs appeared
		from out of purple and green light. Clearly they were summoned by the break in the circle, by Quadro, but Quadro had no
		control over the monstrous beasts. The creatures spoke telepathically: "Die." And then the 2 huge nightmarish creatures
		proceeded to try and kill us with all due haste.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Quadro ordered us to concentrate on one creature at a time so we could kill one quickly and then surround
		the other and slay it. The idea in itself, since we outnumbered the spider-like horrors, was not a bad one but the creatures
		proved to be invulnerable to fire and all but immune to my arrows and to most all other physical forms of attack. I would
		fire an arrow and the arrow would strike true but a moment later the wound, no matter how terrible, would heal over. Nox
		could do nothing to the creatures with the fire sword and Mewn and her air sword did little but anger the beasts. Only
		the sonic attack of Julin and any purely magical force harmed the creatures in a lasting way. As the battle went of Quadro
		cast haste upon me and even though I fired arrow after arrow the creatures were not really harmed. Quadro attacked the
		spider-horrors head on hoping to kill them with magic. Quadro got too close and one of the razorisn forelimbs struck his
		shield and a rending could be heard as the razor limb slashed through and ripped away Quadro's shield. Julin also had his
		armor destroyed by the same type of attack. Mewn had her magical armor torn down the front and ruined. Rask cast Dismiss
		to banish one of the creatures but it had no effect. It was then that Rask began to glow with a dark radiance. I have never
		seen such dark energy before from Rask. Even his eyes were alight with liquid black magics.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Rask reached out and touched the spider-horror and gouts of black energy surged from Rask and into
		the spider-horror killing it. Rask had slain the beast with only a touch. For a moment Rask did not seem himself and I
		could tell the surge of magical power surprised him. It surprised me. When I turned around I saw that Julin was dead. The
		other Spider-horror killed him. Julin was no longer the Minotaur so that is how I knew he was dead. Polymorphed beings
		revert to their true form when slain. After considerable work the other spider-horror was slain as well but it took a great
		toll on our resources to win the battle. Julin is dead and in order to return him to life we will borrow gold from Meepo
		and Rask will Planeshift us in the morn to The Seven Heavens. I was amazed he could do this but he said he was welcome
		back anytime. So he offered to take us to the first layer of the Seven Heavens to resurrect Julin and to give us respite
		from the traveling we would have to do in order to reach a place that could True Resurrect Julin. Mewn does not want to
		go because she says it is like being dead or something but I told her we were all going. I think it will do her some good
		and I want to see this Seven Heavens Rask talks about because it makes me curious.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I am writing all this while on watch for the night. Julin, his body anyway, is lying motionless not
		too far from me and I can't help but think that my "charmed" life is ended. I have seen tragedy after tragedy from the
		death of Menyoh to the death of the entire group and one point or another but I and Julin have always survived. We always
		managed to survive no matter how bad it got or who else died we always made it out alive. I save Julin and Julin saved
		the group. We in essence seemed charmed to survive no matter the chaos or evil that came against us. It was unspoken that
		we look after one another in battle. Many times I have let arrows fly to help Julin because I felt obligated to help him.
		When a foe pressed me and I was afraid I might be badly hurt or killed I still helped Julin. Thing is Julin did the same
		for me many times and for the rest of the group as well. When I first met Julin he was not like he is now. Julin has grown
		into a hero that chose to sacrifice himself so we could win a battle against the spider-horrors. Julin died saving us all
		and as long as I live I will never forget what he did for me today. Julin gave me another day of life, handed it to me,
		by laying down his own. The charm is ended and the road ahead is unclear and fraught with dangers that cannot be foreseen.
		I am the only member that has been with this group since The Sunless Citadel that has not perished. I feel that with the
		death of Julin a kind of quasi-magical luck has been broken, the charm, not just for me but for the entire group. Things
		just seem harder and I know that even though we will get Julin back, he definitely wants to be True Resurrected, it will
		not be the same. Julin may not be the same. Things change.</p>
	<p class="indented">I was talking to Rask about healing magic just before I started guard duty.</p>
	<p class="indented">He told me he could imbue me with healing magic so I could heal with his magic but with my hands. This
		would be another way to save us in a fight and we need all the angles and upshots we can get. I________ _ _____ _ __ _

	</p>
	<p class="indented"> I had to stop writing abruptly last time because men trained in the way of the Monk and Trolls attacked
		us during my watch. I was startled by a noise and just in time was able to warn the group. Had everyone still been in trance
		or asleep it would have gone badly. The fight was somewhat difficult but we won without exhausting ourselves. Fights like
		that don't come along too often though. Usually we are hurt, in need of healing and tending those that have fallen so they
		do not die. We are growing all the time in strength and knowledge (knowledge is just another type of strength) and it shows
		as we are able to handle threats better and better. We are growing as a group and learning to work as 1 against whatever
		obstacle we might come against. I worry about how having died will affect Julin but I think his attitude toward life might
		just see him through. We will be heading to the Seven Heavens today. Rask is praying for his spells right now. I wonder
		what it will look like...The Seven Heavens, and I wonder how the people (or whatever they may be) will act and react to
		us?
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> _________ _ ____ _ _____ _ _____________ _ ____ _ _ ________</p>
	<p class="indented"> We are heading toward my home as I write this I am sitting upon ground that once I traveled over with
		Deven Arkay and Wilstway. Myself, Mewn, Nox, Quadro and Meepo have returned to Oerik. Rask, Drak and Julin have remained
		in SIGIL. Julin was returned to life in the Seven Heavens but soon all of us went through a portal and traveled to a wondrous
		place called SIGIL. This place is most impossible to describe and it is unlike anything I have ever seen or even been told
		about in a fairytale. It is at once beautiful and dark and helpful and puzzling. An enigma within a conundrum and a question
		I don't even know how to ask and if I asked it would it have an answer or would the answer itself be some impossible riddle.
		This is a good way to explain SIGIL for those that have never been, I suppose? But none the less just remember if you get
		lost it might mean you could never return to your home or to anyplace you ever knew. I was very careful to not get lost
		since certain "keys" are needed to go to and leave SIGIL. The key might be water from the Silver Sea or a bit of sand from
		a certain place or a feather. In my case it was a feather that took me to Celene and since I knew that my home bordered
		the Faerie Kingdom of Celene my mind was set to travel home. I am glad most of my friends decided to travel with me to
		my place of birth. We will be meeting the rest of the group in Rastor.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Drak stayed to do some research of some sort. Rask stayed because "?" and Julin stayed because he joined
		the Sensate. The Sensate as near as I can tell are a group of usually beautiful, if not scantily clad, if so scantily clad
		too, people that experience vast amounts of what life has to offer. The group Julin joined seem to think (I think) if you
		can do it, see it, act it out or go there then do so. Very much the thing our Bard Julin already does so he will be right
		at home in such a clan of people. Julin cannot leave until his initiation is done. Apparently all of us needed a break
		from the constant dungeon crawling we have been doing because once in SIGIL everyone went his or her own way without any
		real worries. I think we needed to be away from each other too.</p>
	<p class="indented"> As I said earlier I am on my way home with some of my friends and will meet the rest in Rastor later.
		I will write more about what I saw and did in SIGIL and the other places I went at another time because what preoccupies
		me now is home and getting back to where I began.</p>
	<p class="indented"> When I was 80 Deven Arkay and Wilstway took me and my brother from our home because of an evil man
		named Ennaker. Ennaker wanted to make my father suffer for stealing his treasure. In truth the treasure was a religious
		icon of St. Cuthbert and my father turned it over to a temple of St. Cuthbert. Ennaker a human adept at evocation magic
		swore vengeance not only on my father but also on his family. Ennaker swore he would kill everyone my father held dear
		and then at last after such suffering leave my father to a ruined life but not until he severed his hands from his body.
		Ennaker was evil and insane. This is a very bad combination. So Deven Arkay and Wilstway (A Gnome female of dubious nature)
		a cunning, cute and dangerous sort protected my brother and me in the woods on our journey to Celene. My family was to
		meet us at Ralph's home if they had dispatched with Ennaker and all was well. My father and mother teleported to Ralph's
		living room the second day after we'd reached Ralph's.</p>
	<p class="indented"> My father was burned and my mother was cut across the arm and had several large bruises on her face
		and neck. The scariest thing for me in all this was that my father held the severed right arm that I could only guess was
		Ennaker's. I got sick and had to go upstairs. My brother stayed and painted on his canvas and sang to himself. Ennaker
		was killed and my mother and father had killed him together. My father kept the arm for reasons to this day I do not know
		and have never asked. I will never ask.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I will be home in Hishn soon and I will be glad to see my family but sad to report of the death of
		Menyoh to her family. It must be done however and so I will tell of her bravery and death and show them the letter she
		wrote me. The letter will help them understand her wishes to not be returned to life better than if I just say that is
		what she wanted. Home. Being home even for a day will be good for my soul. </p>
	<p class="indented"> Hishn the name of my town actually means Speaking wolf but the term went out of common usage about
		400 years ago. Strangely enough this is also about the time the town made its name only Hishn. About 400 years ago Hishn
		had a much longer name: Hishn-Daranuel Ot'Hama. The entire name means "Speaking wolf self-rules this home." Daranuel technically
		means (Ruler by right of birth or ancestry) and Ot use to mean (that or this) but it stopped being used before my father's
		father was even born.
	</p>
	<p class="indented">And Hama means home or resting-place. But Hama was never widely accepted and was considered slang more
		than anything, bad slang at that. So the name became just Hishn. This is what is known as progress I would guess? You can
		thank my mother for the history and word lesson. She must have told me 100 times about how Hishn got a more proper name
		and how she liked the "less proper" one a great deal more. Such was my childhood. It seemed every minute must be about
		some lesson or thing to know or fable or metaphor or how sometimes something may look like a good idea until you trance
		on it. My house was and still is a place to learn first and live second but I miss it and at this moment I miss the learning
		as much as the living I did in Hishn. Quadro seems ready to get going so I will have to put quill to paper some other time.
		I will have to warn Quadro that the Kron Hills can be dangerous since we will be traveling into areas today that are not
		often set foot upon. Mewn is putting water onthe fire and Meepo is finished meditating. I wish I could sit and order my
		mind for just a few minutes and have an arsenal of spells like little Meepo. Wishing never makes it so</p>

			<h2>Entry: 18</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> We are on our way to Enstad. We are on our way because what we seek might be within our grasp. We have
		battled the temple keepers at the Temple of all Consumption and the forces of The Temple of Elemental Evil and at last
		we have defeated Fire, Earth, Air and Water. We managed to destroy all their altars as well. This ended up making Mewn
		unhappy. The destruction of all the altars nullified the power of the elemental swords. Zephyr, the air sword has lost
		all magical enhancements. Nox having the Earth sword didn't seem to care and Julin was only mildly put out. Mewn is most
		unhappy and expressed some mild depression over the nullified weapons. I for one am glad the altars are all smashed since
		they serve to promote the powers of The Elder Elemental Eye. Quadro suggested sternly that we return to town to gather
		supplies and discuss what magic is best to do battle with inside the Fane. I quickly agreed with Quadro but having died
		nearly 3 times just inside the door of the Fane might have made me acquiesce"okay"it did. I am glad to be out of that place
		for now but I know I must go back and I know what that means for me as well. Death is coming, some of us will not survive,
		for whom I don't know but I feel it approaching it is like a fire in my blood. I can feel it.</p>
	<p class="indented"> The Fane------We used 2 lesser elemental symbols and combined them to create a greater symbol. This
		granted us access into the outer Fane. The huge ponderous door slid almost soundlessly down into the recesses of the ground
		when the greater key activated the magic that allowed us to enter. I was glad we could get in but just as the door started
		to lower I felt the cold dread I wrote about earlier. The first room was large and about 60 feet across. It is octagonal
		shaped and across from the door that closed a few moments after we all entered the octagonal chamber is a large staircase.
		I have foreboding about attempting to climb the steps little alone venture onward. Of course almost dying 3 times will
		do that to a person. It did it to me. I am afraid now, as I have never been before. I am not sure I can deal with my fear
		but not knowing must mean I am wrestling with fear not that fear has beaten me? I hope that is why I feel so shaken and
		not that I have lost my nerve and haven't owned up to it yet. I owe Quadro, Mewn, Julin, Nox, Meepo, Rask and Drak. Not
		sure why I wrote their names down but it made me feel better seeing them in print just now. Actually Drak is gone on some
		self-appointed mission to gather Druids to the cause of defeating The Elder Elemental Eye. We needed him in the Octagonal
		chamber against the Arrohawks. We need all the help we can get and I have to face facts we have all the help we are going
		to get, Us. Just us our group is what will be in the Fane. I don't know if we can handle this but I will see it to whatever
		end this quest comes to - No matter what.</p>
	<p class="indented">Earlier before we accessed the Fane door Mewn was captured by the "Queen" of</p>
	<p class="indented">The Water temple after we asked her to attempt a bluff. Mewn pretended to be a member of The Water Temple
		and her bluff proved to be less than believable. A race to save Mewn from torture first and death later began. During our
		search Nox flew me about the place as we searched room to room. As we opened each door, if there was no Mewn we kept moving,
		in a blinding hurry Nox kept saying: "No Mewn move on." After a few minutes I gave up and started yelling her name. Mewn
		did not return my call for her and I began to get dejected. Before we could find Mewn, go flying and searching as I explained,
		we had to kill the "Queen" and her minions. The "Queen" ordered us to surrender and Nox asked a little apprehensively:
		"How fast can you get in there to help me?" I responded: "Like a flash." With just my word Nox being bestowed flight by
		magic sailed into the room and dropped a feather. A feather that turned into a huge boat as it headed for the ground. Nox
		was 10 feet in the air and the boat came crashing down onto the "Queen" and her shocked cohorts. I was shocked too about
		the little white feather turning into a boat. The "Queen" and her minions regrouped as we all followed Nox into the room.
		Meepo hurled a fireball into the wreckage of the boat Nox so ironically delivered against our foes. Water temple/boat.</p>
	<p class="indented">Well anyway, during the beginning of the battle the "Queen" whom I buried an arrow in her shoulder decided
		to pay me back with a spell. She polymorphed me into a sheep. It wasn't long before Meepo used Dispel Magic to revert me
		back to Elven Numenarh but during the short time I was transmuted to a sheep I realized how Mewn and even our enemies must
		feel when such a transformation occurs. A feeling of uselessness and loss along with depressive fear is the only way to
		describe it. Thank you Meepo. After killing The "Queen" and all her cohorts then Nox and I flew about looking for Mewn.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Nox and our search-----After some time and even after I began calling for Mewn as loud as I could we
		couldn't find Mewn. I kept trying to track her and the trail kept going cold. Finally after some more flying around Nox
		set me down near a door and I called out for Mewn again. This time there was an answer but not the one I hoped for. A voice
		said from behind the door: "We have her and if you open the door we will kill her." I said to let her go because if they
		killed her Nox and me would kill them anyway and if we had to force our way in we would kill them too. We told them to
		release Mewn now and we would let them go free. Then Nox started a count down: 10 he said and I followed with 9 and then
		Nox said 8 and I said 7. During this count down to take our offer or face consequences the men behind the door said we
		could not threaten and antagonize them that way. We kept counting: 5, 4, 3, 2 and then the fellows, there were only 2,
		yelled out that they would release Mewn and so this is how we got Mewn back and how 2 scoundrels got to see another sunrise.
		It was another thing altogether getting her magical and other equipment back, but we managed.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Dire Apes-----Mewn sneaking to find out what a noise was came back to tell use that large apes blacked
		our path. It was decided that Mewn would try and sneak past the Dire Apes to see what was beyond their lair. Rask placed
		Sanctuary upon her declaring Mewn all but guaranteed of safety via the spell. Mewn was not safe and she quickly needed
		our help. Everyone rushed into the fray against 7 Dire Apes. During the battle Mewn was knocked down. I could tell she
		fell in such a way that meant she was terribly hurt. During the battle Nox engaged an Ape 1 on 1 and the beast managed
		to get hold of Nox. The Ape grabbed Nox in much the same way Grawl was attacked just before it ripped Grawl open. Nox twisted
		around as the claws pulled at him. Blood splattered and I could hear tearing. Gashes appeared as the Dire Ape tried to
		rend Nox apart but Nox avoided death though he did fall prone. The battle carried on with Meepo helping with his magic
		and Quadro dealing serious damage to the beasts.</p>
	<p class="indented"> As the last Dire Ape fell I ran to Mewn to heal her with the imbued healing magic Rask gave me. I smiled
		at her and told her she was fine. Mewn looked unhappy, scared and worried all at the same time. She nearly died and I understand
		her attitude but it frightened me that she was skittish. Not long after she was the same Mewn again. Nox survived the Dire
		Ape attack mostly because of his mental disciplines and training as a Monk. Rask and his healing magic restored Nox to
		health. With the Dire Apes dead we discovered that what lay beyond their lair was of no particular importance. __________</p>
	<p class="indented">
		In the Octagonal room we battled 4 Arrohawks. The creatures could hover perfectly and still attack from the air with precision.
		The creatures were hard to battle and finding a strategy against them did not work for us. I was knocked to the floor even
		after I dealt horrible wounds to one of the Arrohawks it just kept on going. Rask cast Bears Heart and that gave me strength
		to go on just for a moment. The Arrohawks attacked again and I was rendered unable to respond. I felt myself being swallowed
		up by darkness. It was like I was not really in my body anymore. I felt like I was outside in the darkest place I have
		ever been, then I saw Mewn standing over me with the healing wand. She touched me again and I felt stronger and my wounds
		closed but were not healed completely yet. I'd taken a deep wound to the neck and my chain shirt was covered in my blood.
		Then another Arrohawk came from some place to attack me again. I was struck hard before I could get my bearings and decided
		on what to do, with a vicious strike. Moments later the Arrohawk that struck me threw lightning at me. This occurred more
		than once and I fell once more as the thin string of lightning stole from me the last of my resolve. Resolve to stay awake,
		to live.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> In darkness I lay inside myself inside some place I have never been. It was as if my soul was retreating
		from something. Perhaps trying to escape death?</p>
	<p class="indented">The thing was I knew my soul wasn't in danger but my body was in danger, grave danger, and dying. Yet
		my soul went some place it had never been. Not outside in the darkest place I speak of but to some place where my soul
		and I are most close. I don't know what it means but something was whispering to me. The whispering was not Numenarh the
		awake and logical mind of me or my soul. Or anything that is of me, in me or from me, it was not physically or spiritually
		part of me. </p>
	<p class="indented">As the whispering started I felt uneasy. I don't know what the whispering said or what it did to me
		or for me or against me or if it did anything at all other than be somehow heard by me. I suppose the whispering could
		be my imagination. All I know is Mewn pulled me from that place where there is only a whispering "nothingness?" This is
		the reason for my fear I have written about involving returning to the outer Fane. I don't want to die, but I feel the
		whispering was important. Or maybe I just wish it were important for good or ill so that I might focus on it rather than
		my near death? An answer I have it is questions I need. I know the truth I suppose but writing it down will make me face
		up to something I am not prepared to consider. But not writing it down denies the very reason for the journal. Private
		thoughts for now and reflection for another time. I know the truth and the truth is I am being called by "__________" the
		unknown. The whispering is from somewhere, someplace and the answer is the whispering calls me. Questions: Why, who or
		what, where from and why me? These are but a few questions I have. Other Questions: Was it a trick of my mind or was I
		hearing Mewn and the others trying to save me? I was between life and death so it's possible I heard them but thought it
		was whispering from some distant place. The unease I felt could have been the subconscious fear of death. As I write in
		my journal I keep suggesting other reasons for the whispering. Other than what I know to be the truth. I know the truth.
		I just don't know why I know.</p>

			<h2>Entry: 19</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented">Cultist</p>
	<p class="indented"> Varachan</p>
	<p class="indented"> The word Cultist and the name Varachan were not written by me but by people whom were tortured and
		mutilated. The people had their tongues cut away. This Varachan held these people captive and subjected his captives to
		harsh conditions to say the least about the treatment of those we found in the "closet" they were held captive within.
		Julin and I elected to take the prisoners we found to safety. This took several hours________________</p>
	<p class="indented"> During the time Julin and I were gone the rest of the group met Varachan. Varachan swears to have changed.
		Varachan claims that he, as of now, is on the side of good. Varachan promises to pay for regeneration spells for all the
		captives who lost their tongues because of his evil. Varachan himself cut their tongues out for no other purpose than to
		do it. I don't know if I trust Varachan but he does seem to honestly want to help us defeat the Doomdreamers and keep the
		dark god imprisoned. Varachan told us of prince Thrommel. Telling us of Thrommel is the greatest indication Varachan may
		have changed his ways and somehow went from brutally evil to good or at least penitent. What of Thrommel and why is he
		important?</p>
	<p class="indented"> The battle with the horde of The Elemental Evil and of cultist is an older story than the one I have
		been writing about. Evil has arisen before and because of such banality heroes were born or made and one of these heroes
		was Thrommel. Emridy Meadows is the place the hordes of evil were crushed by forces from Furyondy, Veluna, Verbobonc and
		other realms assembled to meet the immense forces of evil. The great hero Thrommel was the military leader of these forces.
		The defeat of the evil I write of occurred in 569 CY. If this was the only accomplishment Thrommel ever helped achieve
		he would have been known as a great man and his story would have been told again and again. A hero among heroes who commanded
		such mighty forces in cooperation against dark-hearted souls is by far enough of a task to be known as hero. But unifying
		Furyondy, Veluna and Verbobonc was to be his next goal. Thrommel was to marry Jolene of Samprastadar and in doing so unify
		many realms against the villainy of Iuz.</p>
	<p class="indented"> In 573 CY Thrommel disappeared without a trace. Jolene withdrew from the public eye in sorrow and all
		talk of unification was lost. Thrommel and his fate have been a mystery, until now. Varachan told us of Thrommel and in
		the telling we learned Prince Thrommel is a vampire. We were also told Thrommel was within our reach. Julin became excited
		at hearing this and wanted to at once rescue Thrommel by first destroying him, as a vampire, and resurrecting him so that
		Thrommel would once again be human and untainted by the evil-mantle of vampirism. I agreed that the plan be moved upon
		at once. At the time of the discovery our strength was somewhat low but losing the opportunity to return Thrommel to Furyondy
		could not be overlooked. We were divided as a group as to rest first and prepare spells and go in fresh or to go in taxed
		from a rather harrowing earlier battle. The decision was made quickly but with much doubt by those of us, Julin and I,
		whom wanted to go with all due haste. Even I who said we should go without waiting another moment had doubts and told everyone
		that perhaps all of us would not survive and in doing so declared I would willingly give my life to return Thrommel to
		Furyondy. Quadro and Rask were the most opposed to entering the vampire Thrommel's lair but with the vote narrowly in favor
		to attack the vampire without rest</p>
	<p class="indented"> Varachan told us how to avoid set traps and at a certain door we were to say "The dark god watches."
		In order to avoid a certain magical trap. Julin forgot what door to speak the words and before I could stop him Julin opened
		the door and triggered the magical trap. Large black tentacles sprang from a glass table in the center of the room and
		attacked us. I was able to fell 3 of the 8 tentacles that flailed at us and the group destroyed those remaining. Nox and
		I had come up with a plan to coat the room in fire using Flame Strike and Fireball. Nox would be the benefit of my Resist
		Elements spell, attuned to resist fire, and hopefully with his skill as a Monk and some luck Nox could escape being burned
		to death. This plan, however, was not enacted though because it took Nox slightly longer to find the hidden lever to revel
		the vampires coffin and our group already anxious forgot the plan and entered the room. Upon entering the room we discovered
		something dismaying. The room was magically silenced. Julin would be able to use none of his magical bardic abilities as
		magical silence acts as an anti-magic zone against Julin. I also got a terrible feeling once I entered the room where the
		vampire slept. Something was wrong</p>
	<p class="indented"> Nox found the lever and the floor slid back to reveal a coffin about 20 feet below the surface of the
		floor. It was not long until we were face-to-face with the vampire and doing battle with it. During the battle Mewn was
		dominated and ordered to attack me. I was in the corner of the room when suddenly Mewn struck me with her sword.</p>
	<p class="indented"> __________ ____________ _ _ ____ _ _ _ _ _ _ _________</p>
	<p class="indented"> The battle continued as Thrommel kept trying to dominate other members of our group while Quadro took
		the fight to Thrommel. Quadro climbed into the pit to attack Thrommel. Quadro delivered solid attacks with his weapon and
		Thrommel likewise used his sword on Quadro. I kept expecting Rask to use some Unbringer power or bleat holy light or something
		but he did not. I continued to fire arrows into the vampire all the while trying to avoid Mewn who kept cutting into me
		with her sword. I knew she was dominated and I was using the spell shield and instead of focusing on the vampire I used
		shield to guard me against Mewn. The shield helped foil 2 of her attacks but still she was hurting me. At one point Mewn
		attacked me the same way I saw her attack earlier at the gymnasium where she'd been training and I was able to dodge her
		attack. It was almost as if Mewn was trying to kill me but by attacking me in exactly the same way as I saw in the gymnasium
		she was trying to give me a way to avoid her assault. Some part of Mewn was trying to fight the domination and while she
		could not refuse an order I think Mewn resisted in all the ways she could. Nox saw Quadro was seriously wounded and with
		his great speed Nox swept into the pit grabbing Quadro and in seconds the 2 were outside the room. I didn't know Nox and
		Quadro had formulated a plan of sorts while in the silenced area so at first I thought Nox was just getting Quadro to safety
		lest he die, but though that served a secondary, coincidental, purpose the true reason was for Quadro to cast a spell.
		Quadro polymorphed the vampire into a fish. I was exceedingly glad because I felt the battle could be won with this sudden
		turn. Since vampires can change shape the polymorph would only last a short while since once the vampire tried to change
		shape the polymorph spell would be broken. This gave us just enough time to nearly destroy the vampire. When the undead
		creature tried to turn to mist Nox, Rask and Quadro were there to answer with swift attacks, with all our efforts the vampire
		Thrommel was destroyed and a great evil was banished from the world.</p>
	<p class="indented"> All that remains is to Planeshift, after Rask rests and prays for his spells, to The Seven Heavens
		resurrect Thrommel and rightfully return him to Furyondy. If we can achieve the feat of returning Thrommel to life before
		the cultist and if Thrommel himself wants to be resurrected then and only then will a great good be returned to the world.
		I can stand for some good right now. As I stay awake and everyone else sleeps I am inwardly praying to Rao and telling
		him all that has occurred involving Thrommel and I am asking his guidance involving the dark god as well. I pray to Rao
		because of what he means to me and what he does mean to the world at large. As I wrote earlier the conflict with the forces
		of The Temple of Elemental Evil is older than this journal and in fact ancient though not ancient beyond reckoning.</p>
	<p class="indented"> The Word of Incarum, the most Holy Scripture of the adherents of Rao, teaches that the Lord of peace
		granted the humans of Oerth the moons Celene and Luna. This was done so that the light might bring guidance from the tyranny
		and darkness of an age ruled by dreaded Tharizdun. I chose to worship Rao because he gave light to an otherwise dark world.
		In the face of unrelenting and suffocating evil Rao gave light, celestial light, to guide the humans of Oerth. He did not
		choose their path but instead illuminated the darkness giving rise to possibilities where none existed before. To be always
		at peace and in harmony and yet lend great help to the forces of good without fighting or using subterfuge is a wondrous
		thing indeed.</p>
	<p class="indented">______________ _ _ _ __ _______________ _ _ ___________ _ _ _ ____</p>
	<p class="indented"> I have chosen to join the Harmonium and I wonder if I have made the correct choice? Of course Mewn
		would think I hav</p>
	<p class="indented">
		Mewn just walked over to me after surveying the room and she whispered to me something I am not sure I was supposed to hear
		and then she kissed me "On the lips"</p>
	<p class="indented"> All I could say was "Not normal." And I must have offended her because she gave me a look I have not
		seen since she was dark Mewn. She asked me what I meant and I said something to her that made her "happy" and she smiled
		at me and said "Me either." And walked away from me in what I could only call a playful manner. I guess? But what is troubling
		me more than Mewn kissing me is the fact that I don't in the least know what I said to her after I said "Not normal." I
		just went blank after the kiss and I know I was talking and looking at her but I don't know any of what I said and only
		half of what I saw during those few moments we talked after the kiss. Mewn kissed me. I wonder what Menyoh would think
		if she read this entry? I wonder what I think too</p>

			<h2>Entry: 20</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented">Many things have happened to us since last I wrote. Mewn was killed by the combined efforts of an Earth
		Elemental and a Stone Giant. I was beside her when she was struck down. I used a healing arrow to try and keep her alive
		but she perished before my eyes and I was powerless to help her. I don't know what more I could have done. Mewn was killed
		after the group walked up a short spiral staircase and opened a door. I stayed behind in case the staircase and the crumbling
		ceiling collapsed since I would be the only one left to dig them out. The staircase held and when the group opened the
		door Mewn was quickly and savagely attacked. I raced to the aid of the group and seeing Mewn critically hurt I shot her
		with a healing arrow. Mewn thanked me and then another attack from the stone creatures killed Mewn and I had no say in
		the matter. Sometimes things happen quickly, to quickly to do anything except be a part of what is occurring. </p>
	<p class="indented">After deliberation we decided to raise Mewn form the dead rather than true resurrect her. This would
		leave Mewn weaker than before she died but it would return her to us now. Quadro, Meepo and Nox felt that time was of the
		essence where The Elder Elemental Eye was concerned. Time was a problem and leaving to resurrect Mewn could be all the
		time needed to free Tharizdun. MY friends feel dark things are on the rise and so I took the words of my friends soberly.
		I too think time is running out for us to find a way to thwart the plans of the evil cultist. I only hope Mewn understands
		what we must do. I pray she will be strong enough to endure what is coming. I pray all of us will be strong enough when
		the battle is joined.
	</p>
	<p class="indented">The battle that means everything is at hand, the end and the beginning will at once be the same. If
		the cultist win a horrid age of darkness could befall the land and it will be a new beginning for Tharizdun and his minions.
		Certainly it will be the end of all my friends and myself. But if we are the victors and thwart the plans of releasing
		Tharizdun from his prison then a new beginning for our group might be possible. Without the threat of Tharizdun escaping
		his prison we could focus on our lives, family and the future.</p>
	<p class="indented">Mewn was raised from the dead and as Nox said she was weaker but this time I didn't sense the same trepidation
		from her as in the past. Mewn seems to be dealing with being killed more easily now. I am not sure that is a good thing.
		In fact I wasn't worried but now I am worried. After returning Mewn to her body we carried on down more passageways until
		we met of all people Kellah. Kellah is a ranger who told us not to build a fire near the temple. Funny she doesn't remind
		me of Menyoh anymore. Wonder why? Kellah told us of a Beholder that is in a pit and of several other dangers but I don't
		know what she said after she spoke of the Beholder. I met a Beholder when I was training to become a soldier in the Harmonium
		and from what I understand the creatures are very powerful. Beholders I know can emit anti-magic rays from their central
		eye and direct eyestalks to devastating effect. They always hover and can fly, sort of, from place to place. I know Beholders
		are vicious in battle and being told one blocked our way made me ill. I felt several of us might die fighting the creature.
		We discussed at length a plan to kill the Beholder. I was most concerned with Nox being worried as well. But Quadro and
		Drak acted like it would not be a problem at all. It is something we have to do is how they looked at the coming battle
		with the Beholder. No one was more apprehensive than I was about the Beholder and what could happen to us.</p>
	<p class="indented"> The battle was joined with Nox leading the way Mewn close behind and Meepo using magic to phase through
		a wall to attack the Beholder. Nox, Mewn and Meepo attacked the Beholder one after the other. Nox actually dodged 3 rays
		that shot from the eyestalks and then he leaped into the pit and struck the creature a telling blow. It was the most amazing
		site as Mewn and Meepo each attacked once and then it was over. The Beholder was slain by Nox, Meepo and Mewn alone. I
		looked at Quadro and told him it was dead. Quadro from where he stood couldn't even see the Beholder yet and in seconds
		the creature had been felled. We all cheered and roared with laughter that the abomination was dead.</p>
	<p class="indented"> After the battle with the Beholder some of us namely Rask got it in his head we were too tough to beat.
		We killed the abomination and it did nothing to us. Ha-Ha-Ha. Well, not long after the Beholder fight Rask changed his
		mind. I should hope he did anyway.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> We were faced with Stone giants, as many of us as there were them, which tested our resolve. I noticed
		Rask being beaten badly by the giants and I thought he might die if he was not helped. I fired my arrows and attacked as
		I could but it was Meepo, Nox and Quadro who did the most to help the situation. Mewn dodged in and out of harms way and
		Drak harried the creatures. Julin used his sonic strike until he was backed into a corner and like Drak and Rask found
		himself pinned by the giants. Mewn, Quadro and me attacked Stone giants that were threatening our more hurt comrades and
		Meepo used intense fire to burn the giants. Several times it looked like we might be overwhelmed but we were able to survive.
		Actually I thought Rask had been killed but later I saw him up but bloody and in need of healing. Except for the battle
		with the Arrowhawks, I spelled the name wrong before, I have never been closer to dying. I could feel my body giving out
		during the fight just like when we faced the Arrowhawks. It is a feeling I don't like being reminded of.</p>
	<p class="indented"> As I said so much has happened. All of us are pushing our skills and abilities to the limit every day.
		All of us are trying to expand our abilities, learn new things and be part of a team. It isn't easy. Not easy for me anyway.
		I find myself thinking that I am the weakest member of the group. The rest of the group has discovered or invented ways
		to battle the enemy and at all times each of them seem to be stretching the bounds of what is possible for them as a person.
		I feel like I, sometimes, am just Numenarh with a bow and nothing more. Besides my arrows flying and words of encouragement
		what do I offer the group? Nothing is what else I offer them. I know I am friend to every member and they are friends to
		me but from a battle standpoint I can only fire arrows. I have no great magic to unleash or special battle tactics that
		help me dodge attacks and hold hallways like Nox. I cannot tumble or cartwheel behind my enemies and take them unaware.
		I can't hurl sonic attacks with unrelenting fury or change shape into hulking animals like Drak. I cannot heal with divine
		magic that I can claim my own neither can I call down divine fire or slay the living with a touch. I can do none of these
		things or even as much. I am simply Numenarh with a bow, and nothing more, it is all I know. When Celeste taught me the
		art of Arcane Archery I didn't realize the commitment and work that would be needed to gain any results at all. I have
		studied and trained my mind and honed my body and tried as best I can but I have yet to master, or even learn, how to use
		magic to alter my arrows to great effect. I can enchant them with guiding magic but have not learned the truly magnificent
		ways of the Elven war bands as yet. I don't know if my skills and talents will be of much use to my friends when the battle
		that means everything comes. But I know this I will die for them if I must. If the only help I can give them is my death
		then my death it shall be. I will do whatever I must to stand in the way of what would harm the group so that they might
		win the day.</p>
	<p class="indented">Julin, the Bard extraordinary whom first asked me if I was a Ranger and I responded: "I Range." Has
		become a soul to be reckoned with. His ability to wield magic and protect not only himself but also others has grown and
		expanded in scope and aspect that none could have guessed. Julin was made a Knight by the king of Furyondy and he deserved
		it even before the rescue of Thrommel.</p>
	<p class="indented">Rask, Unbringer and destroyer of evil was an ill tempered and lazy Cleric of St. Cuthbert when I met
		him. Now Rask can channel great divine forces and wield divine magic to strike down his enemies. The power Rask has gained
		dismays me at times because I see the gleam in his eye when dark radiance surges over his hands and he kills with a touch
		or calls down divine fire or achieves some other feat worthy of, I think in his mind, so few. Rask is still lazy but not
		as ill tempered for the most part. He seems to have growing animosity toward Quadro and a dislike of Julin seems to be
		resurfacing. But above all I am concerned about his snide and rebellious comments to Quadro and lackluster willingness
		to heal the injured. Rask was made a Knight by the king of Furyondy and he does deserve it though I think Rask believes
		he deserves much more than Knighthood. I often wonder what Rask thinks the world owes him, coin, a living, reverence?</p>
	<p class="indented"> Meepo, the sorcerer has come from humble beginnings to arise as one of the most mighty of our group.
		Meepo has a kind heart but each day as he learns more he becomes more and more like those he hangs around. Meepo is losing
		his naivete. Meepo is gaining power and ego. But I think Meepo can handle such things better than Rask can and so I don't
		really worry about Meepo becoming pompous and self-centered and ultimately a bad Kobold. Meepo is powerful and his magical
		talents have helped us and in truth saved us at times. Meepo was made a Knight by the king as well and Meepo, the sorcerer
		deserves each and every privilege knighthood entails.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Drak, Drak can change into animals and he cast the spell creeping cold a lot, the spell chills and
		freezes things. Drak is a Druid and a difficult fellow to figure out by any standard I know. He is cold and standoffish
		and takes to wondering around at times and he can go days without speaking to any of us save his bear. Drak was made a
		knight by the king of Furyondy though the king dislikes Drak personally. Drak doesn't care if the king or any king likes
		him or not. Drak doesn't even care if we like him I suppose. I don't know Drak.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Nox, the Githzheri is careful and reckless all in the same. Nox can usually meet the challenges for
		himself that he sets so his recklessness is more than not a self-imposed trial by fire. Nox does not speak often but when
		he does his opinion is listened to and given great weight. Nox has never endangered the group and does all he can to protect
		us and shield us from enemies. I am proud to call him friend. Nox still has to travel to Furyondy at some point to be officially
		knighted and receive his reward if he wants to ask for one that is. I am not sure what Nox would want but it will not be
		for material gain or show. Nox will ask for something practical and helpful to him in his battle against the cultist or
		what ever other evils he may face in the future. Nox seems to always think ahead but still remain solidly in the moment
		he is in and deal with what is now.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Nox in the battle with the stone giants was banished in a blaze of light. I asked Quadro if Nox was
		dead because I was not sure what happened. The spell was divine and called Blasphemy. Rask had no idea what it was but
		Quadro knew and I was glad to learn that at some point perhaps in a few days to a week Nox could return to us. Apparently
		Blasphemy weakens those native to this world while banishing or sending back to their native plane all outsiders. Not sure
		how divine magic works but I know the spell that sent Nox back to Limbo made me physically ill.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Quadro, the leader has proven himself as a leader and willing to take great risk to help the group.
		Quadro has grown as a leader and leads by majority most of the time but when it is needed he does step in and make command
		decisions. Quadro has combined a unique fighting style that fits seamlessly with his adept magical talents. I am proud
		to call him friend. Quadro was knighted as well and upon being knighted he asked for a fife of land in Furyondy. Furyondy
		is in constant embattlement with Iuz and so asking for a fife of land is the same as asking for a fight and another fight
		and a fight again only to be faced with at some point a war. Skirmishes and battles are frequent but at some point a full-scale
		war will erupt. Quadro wants to be a part of it I guess. Like Julin, Quadro seeks fame but in a different way. I think
		Quadro wants to be remembered as a great man in history. Nothing is wrong with that as long as he does not lose sight of
		how he got famous and why. Dwarves have a long memory so I am not worried Quadro will forget his friends, or his enemies.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Mewn, the Cipher is important to the group. She is our scout and often meets the enemies we battle
		first. Standing against such foes takes great courage and I might add great skill. Mewn has developed her talents well
		but learning from her mistakes she doesn't do so well. I wish she were not scout because is puts her in such constant danger.
		I would rather Mewn stay in the middle of the group formation. But depriving her of her "wings" and stopping her from doing
		what she feels is her job would be the same as killing her in the long run. There are no easy answers Mewn. If you fall
		I must let you fall. If you find success I will be happy for you. Tragedy or triumph I will be by your side and I will
		make sure you are protected and sheltered with all the skills and talents I possess. Mewn takes great pains to make sure
		evil does not catch us unaware and for this she should be rewarded. Mewn was made a Lady, same as a knight, by the king
		of Furyondy and I can tell it impressed her. I was not sure she wanted to dance so I did not ask. After she was dead in
		my arms at the stair well and after I watched over her body in the night I felt differently. I should have asked if she
		wanted to dance and I should have told her that she means a lot to me as scout and she is a valuable member of the team.
		I am not sure Mewn knows how much help she is. In time Mewn will come into her own and when she does she will do something
		great that will be remembered.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Our path together as a group is one that will lead to glory and riches if we are careful. It will lead
		to power as well. I have already seen a glimpse of it during the celebration when we were knighted. Together we are strong
		and more than we could have ever been separately. Our lives are like a twisting of cords that make a rope, once the cords
		are 1 the rope is all that remains. We have become an adventuring rope/</p>
	<p>Numenarh, the Ranger is a cord twisted in place, part of a masterwork ensemble. Nothing more nothing less. I was given
		the honor of knighthood as well. A knight, soldier, son, once husband and twisted cord is what I am. Can I be anything
		else? When will I be a hero like my friends?</p>
	<p class="indented">I always ask myself questions and have tried to find the hero that I hoped was in the heart of my being.
		So far I have found courage and stoic strength to go on in spite of my failure as an archer, wizard and a ranger. They
		are better than I am and I don't deserve to be with them, part of them, or have bestowed upon me what riches and glory
		they have and will have as time goes by.</p>

	</p>
	<p class="indented"> The day I dreaded came. I was killed. 2 Iron constructs towering twice my height attacked the group.
		Magic, nor arrow, or any weapon could do harm to the constructs save the sword of Nox that was enchanted by Rask.</p>
	<p class="indented"> My body was broken by the soulless constructs. I felt my ribs give way as the mighty iron fist crashed
		into me. I was spun around toward Rask and Mewn and could only think to say my mother's name. I had told Rask and Mewn
		that if I died my mother wanted word of it by letter. Last when I saw her she asked to be notified immediately should I
		be slain. I don't know why she wishes this but she does. I uttered half her name before a second Iron fist struck me but
		before that I knew I would die, it was over for me, so I accepted it.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I felt my neck break and I fell to the floor. Blood droplets from my mouth splayed into the air and
		I watched as those same droplets came back toward me. The droplets of blood, some of them, struck my eyes but there was
		no pain by then and I was losing my sight too, so it did not matter. I was dying or more to the point already dead. No
		one could help me or save me this time so I perished</p>
	<p class="indented"> I was dead a day so I see no use in bothering my mother with news that will only upset her. I have
		told Rask and Mewn not to send a letter telling her of my death. Besides it is a personal thing that I would like to keep
		between the group and me.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> The group took me to Furyondy and used my "favor" the king bestowed to have me returned to life with
		powerful magic. Julin will be returned to life as well. Julin died after I was killed trying to protect him and Drak.</p>
	<p class="indented"> When I was returned to life I had no memory at all but I felt it all coming back to me quickly. I started
		remembering things in perfect order and each minute of every hour of ever day of all my years came back to me with crystal
		clarity. I grabbed the Elven woman by the arm, I didn't know it was Mewn but I knew I would know her in a few seconds,
		to help keep me from showing how excited I was about having been dead and once more alive. I did not know why knowing I
		was dead and once more alive was exciting but I knew I would remember. I did remember.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Being dead excited me. Or more to the point what happened while my soul was away from my body excited
		me. I was dead and my soul went elsewhere and when my soul was returned to my body this was the revelation and the source
		of my exuberance. I could not show such happiness to the group, as they would wonder why I was acting this way. I hid it
		from them for that reason
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> When I died I lost all hope and when I was returned to life I still had no hope at all. I had no hope
		because I have become hope. I lost all faith because I have become the faith I had. My soul was poured back into my body
		and in the rejoining I became a singular entity. From the moment of my birth to the last thing that happened before I died
		I remember it all in perfected order without flaw. I have become the sum of all my experiences because I know what it is
		like to experience each single moment of my life as if it were yesterday. I no longer have power I am become that power.
		All weakness in me is destroyed or simply no longer a concern. I am beyond so many things now.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I am stronger, faster and more able than before and each day I live will only make me more so. I found
		what was lacking in me by being deprived of life. When my soul returned, the true part of me, it brought with it a unifying
		force.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> Within me is the power to be what I must be to meet the challenge to do what must be done to win what
		must be won. I am Numenarh Daerkwood and I have found my inner vision. If Rask thinks he's the destroyer of evil he has
		a rude awakening coming. If Rask thinks he is getting away with the things he has been getting away with anymore Rask is
		dead wrong. I can step away from friendship and be the law if I must.</p>
	<p class="indented"> The heart of evil, The Doomdreamers, must be cut out and all their evil plans put to ruin. With my
		friends by my side we will slay or destroy whatever dark group, creature or thing is put before us and we shall have wings
		as eagles and a countenance of lightning and our words will be as swords and our prayers like fiery hammers. We will not
		simply be heroic we will be heroes of legend. </p>
	<p class="indented">Drak Nox Quadro Mewn Julin Meepo Rask</p>
	<p>Numenarh</p>
	<p class="indented">We shall have glory and riches and I swear we will have our victory over Tharizdun my friends. Nothing
		can sway me from what I know must be done and having sacrificed my life I have given all I have and so there is nothing
		left to take. Only strength and determination remain. I am my strength and I am my determination. I have never been beaten
		so badly before and it will never happen again. NEVER. It can't because I will not allow it.</p>

			<h2>Entry 22</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> Julin, Nox, Mewn, Meepo and me are awaiting the return of Quadro, Drak and Rask. Rask was killed and
		Quadro and Drak teleported away to have Rask returned to life. The rest of the group and I went on searching as we knew
		the time was close at hand for the culmination of The Doomdreamers plans. Upon searching around we found a black altar
		and upon it a man to be sacrificed. An Ogre played a drum and a woman dressed all in black chanted. From here things get
		much worse.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> Julin realized the altar could be used to break Tharizdun from his prison. I guess seeing it triggered
		something in that vast storehouse of information that is the mind of Julin Sandar. But things get worse after this realization.
		The element of surprise so rarely ours and more often the enemies became lost, as usually occurs with us, and replacing
		it was stark terror. 2 town people we had rescued transformed into tiger-like creatures with scowling faces and backward
		hands that only added to their dark charisma. Truly these creatures looked at us as playthings to be done with what ever
		their wicked minds could conceive. Glaring intelligence could be seen in their eyes and before any of us could make reactions
		both tiger-like humanoids began to cast spells. With time against us and minus Quadro, Drak and Rask we all looked at one
		another and committed ourselves to the fight in a flash.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Julin sent sonic attacks at the drum playing Ogre and the drum fell silent as the Ogre fell dead. Meepo
		cast fly upon me to give us the advantage. We were in a room with a 60' ceiling so me able to fly about and send arrows
		down upon the enemy would be of great use. Ha! Ha!</p>
	<p class="indented"> The Tiger- like creatures began to fly as well. The creatures were regaled with defensive magic and
		it seemed that neither magic, nor arrow could penetrate their defenses or harm their hide. I got even with them in the
		air and fired arrows to no effect. Julin became all but overwhelmed by some magic the altar sent against us but still Julin
		used his ability to disrupt thoughts against the Cleric woman at the altar. His action did not save the man upon the altar
		though. A black tentacle erupted from the onyx slab and pulled the sacrifice, apparently, into the altar itself. Though
		I know the man suffered a much worse fate than being trapped in an altar. He had become an offering to Tharizdun. In place
		of the sacrifice a gift was left the woman in black robes. Just after she put on the amulet that The Elemental Eye gave
		her though Julin used his magic to disrupt her mind while Nox engaged her in hand-to-hand combat. The woman could defend
		herself but she was unable to cast spells or use magical items, as her mind was too confused. </p>
	<p class="indented"> Meanwhile Meepo and I along with Mewn were trying to deal with the Tiger-like humanoids, I must find
		out what they are called, and each time we attempted something we were rewarded with fire attacks from enemies no spells
		or arrows could harm. I felt we could still win if someone or I was able to pierce their magical defense. They could not
		be unbeatable and I knew then that they could be defeated. But how?</p>
	<p class="indented"> Earlier before the Tiger-humanoids attacked us and while we planned a course of action I cast Resist
		Elements and tuned the spell to resist fire. I am able to cast this certain spell 2 times and so I gave the fire resistance
		to Julin and Mewn. The Tiger-humanoids kept sending fireball attacks at us and during the unrelenting assault Meepo fell
		and was near death. His burned body was giving out. I was struck with fire attacks as well but I managed to withstand their
		assail. I can no longer be so simply defeated so I did all that I could to help our cause. I welcomed the fireball strikes
		against me because it would save my friends pain and possibly save them from death. </p>
	<p class="indented">The cloaked woman was slain by Nox and with her dead Julin struck out with sonic strikes against the
		flying Tiger-like sorcerers. It was now I realized as many fireballs as they have prepared they could only be sorcerers
		or very stupid wizards. Since we could not harm them and their defense and strategy confused us so much I tend to think
		they were cunning. Sorcerers are what they are, or rather what they were before we killed them.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Using the magic talents of Meepo, Julin and my skill with a bow and daring tactics from Mewn who ran
		the walls to get above the Tiger-backward-hand evil minions we did not prevail. No magic, arrow or physical attack harmed
		these creatures. Nox used a psionic power that Nox calls Mind Blast and with this power Nox rendered our foes their swansong.
		The psionic attack from Nox sent the evil backward-hand minions into a momentary frenzy. The creatures looked shocked that
		Nox harmed them. Then a moment after their startled expressions disappeared so too did their look of superiority and for
		that matter their glaring intelligence seemed to be gone too. Nox had given their minds a psionic shock and their perceptions
		were numbed and the very will to fight quelled. My arrows struck deep within their evil hide and in a bloody heap the backward-hand
		evils fell to their death.</p>
	<p class="indented"> This was not the end of the battle though. We had to destroy the altar and Nox was elected. However
		a curtain, a kind of construct, came to life and attacked Nox. The once blue curtain took the form of brown-green tentacles
		and with no problem they grappled Nox and tried to pin him within their grasp to make him helpless. I could tell the tentacles
		were squeezing the air out of him. Nox only could take short agonizing gasps of air. Lifted off the ground Nox was nearly
		helpless as more tentacles tried to entangle themselves around him. Nox somehow prevented several attempts of other tentacles
		from grabbing hold of him but he was powerless to cast off the tentacles that were trying to crush him. Nox saved us and
		it was time for us to return the favor.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Meepo, Julin and Mewn set about attacking with all their might the magical curtain construct while
		I pierced with deadly accuracy the tentacles that held Nox. In the end the curtain reverted to a useless tattered hulk
		hanging from the ceiling. We'd won and the victory had been hard won at that, so it was all the more savored. I am not
		sure what happened next exactly I just know that an elephantine fungus creature began screaming in a booming voice that
		she was a god and our doom. I with the help of Nox and Mewn pulled down the useless curtain to reveal a dark sanctuary
		that housed a massive fungal creature resembling ever vaguely a massive mushroom.</p>
	<p class="indented"> We ran away, more exactly I grabbed up Mewn and Julin and flew us away from the goddess, if that is
		what she is, or what have you. With Mewn weakened by a curse and Julin rendered weak by the altar and Nox hurt and bruised
		I thought it best to run away with all due haste than to fight a demon goddess of fungus. I am sure no one disagreed with
		me. Meepo was able to ghost form in the wall and meet us in the triangle room later.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Drak, Rask and Quadro have returned. Now we can make our way back to battle the demon goddess_____
		Rask looks absolutely pissed. I have heard Mewn say so and so looks pissed or I am pissed-off but I have never found a
		need to express myself in this way till just now. Rask is mutterin. No actually he is starting to all but scream about
		Quadro. Quadro looks pissed too, huh, once you start using the word it just keeps getting easier to make use of it. Of
		course using it too much makes it lose its importance. Drak just handed me some expensive healing arrows. 7 to be exact.
		Quadro is talking over Rask and asking Drak how much the arrows cost. Huh</p>
	<p>Numenarh Daerkwood__________</p>
	<p class="indented"> Rask has called for a new leader to be named because Quadro did some things"huh".</p>
	<p class="indented"> Rask wants me to stop writing in my journal and vote</p>

			<h2>Entry: 23</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> Quadro, Julin, Meepo, Nox, Rask, Drak, Mewn, Numenarh and Aeris did all we could do against the Doomdreamers.
		Aeris is a Hound Archon that we set free from magical shackles. I would like to be able to write in this journal that we
		forever rid the world of the threat Tharizdun poses. I wish I could put upon these pages that the Doomdreamers and all
		their hordes of evil are gone, never to return. I cannot write such a thing because it would be a lie. I can however write
		what did happen.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		Our group faced the prince of elemental fire, Lareth, the beautiful and The Second. Of minor trouble was a Medusa that tried
		to turn Drak to stone and managed, too late for it to matter, to blind Nox with magic. During the battle I was invisible
		thanks to Quadro and able to fly thanks to Meepo. A scroll of Cone of Cold would be a handy weapon against the prince of
		elemental fire. We went in prepared but it did not start out that way at all.</p>
	<p class="indented"> The group first entered the throne room depleted of spells and low on other supplies as well. Quadro
		saw we could not win against the elemental prince and Lareth, champion of elemental evil. Quadro ordered a retreat. I was
		wondering why until I saw that the prince of elemental evil was a 25-foot tall giant comprised most notably of fire. We
		escaped to the fire node gateway and luckily were teleported back to the room where the fire seal was located. Some of
		the group went back to town via a Teleportation scroll and returned in all due haste with supplies. We waited one day hoping
		against hope that Tharizdun would not be set free. We would attack at our full potential and win or lose each of us knew
		this was the end of things for the Doomdreamers or us.</p>
	<p class="indented"> The battle was joined. The battle that means everything was not at hand it had begun. I invisible and
		able to fly soared into the air and quickly cast the Cone of Cold scroll upon Imix, prince of elemental fire. Imix roared
		in pain as frost met fire. Quadro cast an even more powerful Cone of Cold than was bound in my scroll and Imix yelled to
		us that we would all die. To those words Julin let loose with Sonic strikes upon the prince of fire. Rask called down holy
		fury to harm our enemies. Drak shapeshifted into a shambling mound in order to attack the Medusa. Nox also took on the
		Medusa. The pairing of Drak and Nox ended quickly what threat the Medusa was to us. Nox was blind by her magic but the
		second was near death because of Mewn and Meepo. Imix was swaying to the symphony of his own destruction. Each sonic strike
		of Julin was joined by words of magic by Rask and Quadro. The chanting and fighting was all I could hear. How strangely
		it did sound like music to me toward the end. Each arrow I sent was punctuation to the spells, deeds and words or my friends.
		Together we destroyed Imix. I got the killing strike but without all of us working in near perfect harmony to undo Imix,
		none of us or I alone, would have had the privilege of the final strike on Imix. Together we were strong and unstoppable
		when it counted most. We did not win without consequences.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Aeris was slain by Imix. Quadro also fell to the withering attacks of the prince of fire. We were without
		a leader. Quadro lay dead. Aeris and Quadro never got to see us bring an end to Imix. But I am sure they will be able to
		read about it after Julin writes it into his so called Epic. No one else was slain during the fight in the throne room.
		I worried about Mewn and Julin during the fight yet they managed to not get killed. Of course to explain the skill, hard
		work and luck it took for any of us to live through it would take far longer than I intend to sit here and write in this
		journal.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> We won.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Before the battle that means everything began we faced deadly enemies and during the battle I was slain.
		Drak used a Druid spell called Last Breath to bring me back to life. I was dead only seconds but during that time I floated
		above my body and I could hear a voice calling to me to come and be with it forever. I almost did not return to my friends.
		Suddenly the magic of Last Breath called me back and it felt like hours before my soul reentered my body. I don't know
		why I felt like so much time was passing because I was dead for only a few seconds but hours is what it felt like before
		I could open my eyes and be among the living again. Odd. </p>
	<p class="indented"> After I returned to life I kept saying I was dead still. don't know why I just felt like all of me
		wasn't here anymore. I had lost my inner vision and was again Numenarh with a bow. Mewn whispered to me that she loved
		me. I told her okay. Later I told her we had lots to talk about. She smiled and told me that yes we did have lots to discuss.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Not unlike a blur was our departure from the Fire node and our journey back to civilization. Julin
		had sonic struck Lareth to the ground and put the dimensional shackles upon him. I made sure Quadro was returned to life
		using True Resurrection. Aeris as Julin tells me will "reform" on his home plane of existence. Okay good for him and whatever?
		don't understand how the "reforming" thing works but it is good for Aeris so I am glad for him.</p>
	<p class="indented">We returned to Civilization</p>

			<h2>Entry: 24</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented">After getting Quadro returned to life I told him Julin would explain what occurred. After all Julin
		and Quadro would be traveling to Furyondy with Lareth as prisoner. Knowing Quadro as I do I know he would want to travel
		with Julin to see Belvor IV. I was correct. Quadro and Julin headed off to Furyondy and just after they were out of sight
		I asked Rask and Drak to travel back to Rastor. I wanted Drak to keep an eye out in the wilderness for cultist for awhile
		and I asked Rask to start up a Temple of St. Cuthbert. I turned to Nox and asked him to be the Sheriff of Rastor. Nox said
		he had a few things to do but that he would be happy to make his way to Rastor later. I nodded to him and we exchanged
		a brief smile. I spoke with Mewn too and our conversation let me know she was going to the Roost and that she wanted to
		spend time with her resurrected father. I understood and it was then I told everyone my plans.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Using my limited yet useful knowledge of Verbobonc laws and customs that I learned while in SIGIL--thank
		you Tripicus for all your help---during research I managed to be made Mayor of Rastor. I think being knighted by Belvor
		IV helped me considerably more than my meager understanding of the government of Verbobonc. None the less Rastor had become
		my responsibility. Legally and officially my responsibility this time though. I knew I would have to leave and go to SIGIL
		and also I wanted to visit Hishn so I left Rastor in the capable hands of Barkin Leatherhand, Nox and a man I have only
		recently met but trust considerably.
	</p>
	<p class="indented">
		Ambergost is a sorcerer and a diplomat of Verbobonc. Ambergost was appointed to help me take care of the government of Rastor
		and show me more how to do my job. In addition he will act as Mayor while I am away in SIGIL. Ambergost is a very charismatic
		fellow and unless something pressing happens Ambergost will stay for one year as liaison between Rastor and Verbobonc.
		Ambergost is also an expert craftsman and woodworker and his skills with wood and brick are needed and appreciated. As
		regal and noble as he appears Ambergost quickly took to helping build things or fixing what needed to be repaired. I am
		glad to call him friend.
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> After traveling around for some while getting everything in order I was able to head toward Hishn.
		On my way I met with a Troll and it attacked me. Suddenly flaming arrows struck the Troll and as I backed away yet another
		arrow struck home this one carrying with it a ball of fire. From out of the woods stepped a half-Elven man. I knew he too
		was an Arcane Archer from the way his arrows held spells. He carried a quiver like mine. We commented on how efficient
		the quivers were for us archers and after some more talking we made camp together.</p>
	<p class="indented"> That night I found out more about Neunah Treewillow. His father is Elven and currently missing. Last
		Neunah heard his father was in the Vesve fighting a massive forest fire rumored to be the work of Iuz. It has been some
		time since the fire and Neunah has not received word from his father whom promised to write him each Month. Until now the
		letters have never failed to arrive more than 2 or at most 4 days later than the end of the Month. I don't know what has
		befallen Eruja Treewillow and I dare not get involved if I want to return home in 3 days hence. Yet if Neunah asks me to
		help him I will join him in his endeavors. </p>
	<p class="indented"> This morning I said good bye to Neunah and wished him well on his journey. Neunah did not ask me to
		help him find his father and so I have gone my own way. I told the young fellow to look me up if ever he was traveling
		near Rastor. I smiled when he responded: "Where is it?"</p>
	<p class="indented"> At last I am home again. Hishn is a welcome sight to me once again. I feel like it has been far longer,
		than is the truth, that I have been gone. I hurried by the School of Tal and met, luckily, with Master Deddashar and he
		told me that Arkay, Wilstway, Olen and Numenarh were about to leave Hishn for some adventure and as Deddashar saw it lots
		of damned hard work too. I bid him fair well as I hurried toward home. Master Deddashar told me that the expedition meeting
		place was none other than my own home. Rushing as I could I bumped into several early arrivals at the Hishn marketplace.
		Toppling melons and knocking over a Halflings cart of goods I had to take pause to pay for the melons and make several
		apologies. It did not help that several people on the street knew me and I had to yell back that I was rushed and needed
		to get some place but I would visit later. Jersus, Felosial and Amarill are those that called for me to stop. Only Jersus
		used my childhood name. Felosial use to until I asked Menyoh to marry me and since that day Felosial has called me Numenarh
		instead of Traearn.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		I rushed home to see my father but found I was an hour late. The expedition had left for a destination my mother was wholly
		unsure of. I questioned her about why she did not know where Tenzanier was going but all she would say was: "Some times
		it just works out that way Numenarh and that is how it goes." I would have asked more but before I could speak with my
		mother more Perenthace pulled at my arm. I have never been one to deny him my time so I followed him into his room. Perenthace
		told me a number of confusing things and then at the last of all the confusing things come the most distressing thing of
		all. My mother was pregnant and Tenzanier was not the father. Of course Peren told me this in a very cryptic set of verses
		but I eventually figured out what he was telling me.</p>
	<p class="indented">I spent the next 5 days with my mother and brother and as I hastily promised I visited Jersus, Amarill
		and Felosial. Felosial was the woman that helped deliver me into the world. My mother had been alone at the time that my
		birth began and Felosial saw my mother in distress. Felosial rushed into the backyard where at the time we had a fruit
		garden and amid the vegetables and fruits I was born. Even my mother says without the healing touch of Felosial she would
		have died but Felosial tells it differently. Felosial speaks of it as simple help given by a simple woman, nothing more.</p>
	<p class="indented"> Today I leave Hishn and I don't know what my mother was thinking when she promised to keep her original
		promise 122 years later. I wonder what my father is thinking too. Will he even come back home? Where has he gone and why?
		Since Tenzanier is with Arkay and other adventurers I am not too worried. My mother and brother are off to Celene to be
		with her family during the pregnancy. Since I need go to Celene as well I will travel with them. I have arranged to meet
		Heloque, a Cleric that owes me a favor from some while back. Heloque will Planeshift me to The Seven Heavens as payment
		of the favor. From there I can find the door to SIGIL.</p>

			<h2>Entry: 25</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented">I have spent 4 Months with the Harmonium and during this time I have come to appreciate law and completely
		understand why not 1 Elf or Pixie lives on Ortho. Working with the Harmonium is hard since sometimes they take the long
		way around or the long view to a problem. Other times, this is rare though, the Harmonium undertakes secret missions. One
		mission I was involved in was planting a perfectly symmetrical garden behind a dwelling. I don't know the purpose of such
		a "mission" but mostly the Harmonium functions without such oddity. Mostly.</p>
	<p class="indented"> I talked with Tripicus again while I was in SIGIL and he told me he thought I was doing fine in my
		endeavors. He commented that I mentioned Mewn and Tenzanier a lot. I miss the group that much is true. It seems that each
		of us has gone our separate ways. Rask barely did any real work on the temple of St. Cuthbert before he left to climb the
		steps of somewhere and do other things. Of course I did not know this until I returned to Rastor. I am writing this
		</section>
		<section class="entry" id="Rastor">
			<h2>Entry in Rastor and in my new home</h2>
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> During the 4 Months I was gone Ambergost and Barkin built me a house. Mayor needs a home don't he is
		what Barkin said and after seeing it and sitting at the table and eating here I realized something. The group is gone.
		I am no longer a part of an adventuring group. Nox I see every day but I have not seen Rask since before I departed Rastor
		and left Ambergost in charge. Ambergost did an amazing job while I was gone. Nicolbolas is hard at work finishing up the
		Temple of Rao while the St. Cuthbert temple is only half finished and with Rask gone not much is being done in the way
		of finishing the thing either. Rask left word with Drak where he was going but Drak refuses to say anything about where
		Rask went. Drak just smiles and says: "If he ain't here he is near and dear." I grimaced when Drak said that about Rask
		and then I kind of agreed. I have not seen Drak since the day after my return and I have been in Rastor now 2 Months. Drak
		reported no cultist or specific bad stuff though he and Nox did take out a small band of thieves that were trying to rob
		from people who wanted to come and live in Rastor. People actually coming to Rastor to live are a minor miracle unto itself.
		Whom am I kidding I even Miss Rask
	</p>
	<p class="indented"> I asked Nox if any of the adventuring group had come to Rastor during the time I was gone to SIGIL.
		Nox told me that Quadro teleported in 3 times during the 4 Months I was gone. Apparently Quadro has a tower now and it
		is something of a small stronghold. Nox said Quadro told him that the king granted him a tower. Amazing to me was that
		when I asked Nox what Julin got for delivering Lareth to Furyondy for imprisonment and our other minor deeds like saving
		the world Nox replied: "Nothing." Being granted a tower by a king is a big deal in itself and I suppose the king believed
		at the time that Quadro would have a group to man and upkeep the tower. But the adventuring group is apparently no more
		so I wonder who is helping Quadro upkeep the tower?</p>
	<p class="indented">8 Months</p>
	<p class="indented"> It has been just more than 8 Months since I have seen Mewn, Meepo and Julin. It has been 6 months since
		I have seen Rask and 2 Months has gone by and Drak is no place to be found. Nox says Drak is like that and Drak will show
		up when Drak is needed, mostly. I have seen Quadro once during the 8 Months since we defeated Imix and captured Lareth.
		Quadro stayed for a short while and in fact so short a time I was not able to show him my new home. Quadro and I talked
		of his tower and how he was gathering a following that worked with him to maintain the tower and his fife of land. Quadro
		has had a few minor problems but for the most part he is doing well for himself. Meepo has spent much of his time with
		Quadro, as I figured, and he too helps with the tower stronghold. Quadro always wanted to be remembered and so goes a milestone
		for the Dwarf.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		I have written Mewn a letter of sorts and sent it by messenger. She knew I would be gone for some time to SIGIL and that
		I needed to stay in Rastor when I returned but to not have gotten a letter or some message from her in 8 Months is perplexing.
		She agreed we had so much to talk about yet she has made no effort to contact me. In truth until now I have made no effort
		to contact anyone either</p>
	<p class="indented"> We have all, for the most part, gone our separate ways. Quadro has his men and tower stronghold. Meepo
		works with Quadro. Julin on occasion, I hear from Quadro, drops by but does not stay at the tower like he and Meepo do.
		Nox I see every day and Rask has yet to return and help finish the work on the temple of St. Cuthbert. Mewn is in Verbobonc
		I guess but knowing Mewn she could be any place at all. She may have even gone to the Gymnasium to work with the Ciphers?
		I wonder where Mewn is? And some place out in the woods is Drak. Nox isn't one for conversation but he gets the job done.
		I see him every day.</p>
	<p class="indented">
		Since nothing much is going on worthy of an Adventuring journal I will put the journal book away for awhile. I've written
		in it so few times since</p>

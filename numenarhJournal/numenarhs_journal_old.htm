<p><span style="color: black;"><font face="Papyrus"><span
 style="">����������� </span>I saw Mewn writing in her diary and when I asked
her what she was doing she responded: �You should try it some time.�<span
 style="">� </span>So after some deliberation I have decided to write down
some of what has been going on.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� I was attempting to barter a ring from this woman at a jewelry
shop when this small group came in.� I did not know 
them at the time nor did I know I would be risking my life soon.� Anyway I was trying to barter a ring to send home and
when these people walk in the shopkeeper forgets me and talks to them instead.�
She mentions her son and others that are missing and that
they went to The Sunless Citadel.� Not a name of a
place one would want to go being sunless and a citadel but apparently these
fellows went and never came back.� This woman offers
money and goods to have the adventurers who walked in look for her son and
his companions.� These fellows agree quickly to help
and then right away one of them turns to me and starts asking me questions�but
first let me explain who these fellows are:����������� ����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������</font> </span></p>
 
<p><font face="Papyrus">�� <span style="">Julin started talking
to me first.�� Julin is a flamboyant human who dresses
in bright mismatching colors that yet seem to fit into his equally clashing
personality.� Julin apparently is a minstrel and I
would learn later has a good voice for singing too. <o:p> </o:p> </span></font></p>
 
<p><span style="color: black;"><font face="Papyrus"><span
 style="">����������� </span>The others that agreed to go to The Sunless
Citadel for profit are Quadro, Barkin (they are both Dwarven) and Rask a
worshiper of St. Cuthbert.<span style="">� </span>Rask is human.<o:p> </o:p> 
</font> 
 </span></p>
 
<p><span style="color: black;"><font face="Papyrus"><span
 style="">����������� </span>Julin asks if I know the area well and can I
lead them to The Sunless Citadel.<span style="">� </span>He wants to know
if I am a Ranger.<span style="">� </span>I respond by telling him: �I range.�<span
 style="">� </span>And so after some more conversation I agree to lead them
to the citadel.<span style="">� </span>Just before we leave---- for the citadel
a second time having come back for rations and to heal Julin-----however
we meet an Elven girl in a bar who is busy stealing, not so discreetly, money.<span
 style="">� </span>For reasons I have yet to fathom Rask, the human Cleric,
asks this Elven girl to come with us in order to stop her from being a thief.<span
 style="">� </span>I opposed this addition to the group by saying: �No.�<span
 style="">� </span>5 times but my words against including her were dismissed.<span
 style="">� </span>So Mewn joined us but with the promise to repay the money
she took.<span style="">� </span>She could not simply return the money because
the barkeep wanted her arrested so leaving it suspected but not confirmed
by the Oakhurst authorities she stole the money was best.<o:p> </o:p>  
</font>  
</span></p>
 
<p><font face="Papyrus"><span style="">����������� </span>�.Later�.after
some traveling we reached the Citadel and made our way through it.<span
 style="">� </span>During our explorations we discovered Kobolds and Goblins
were at war inside the Citadel and we made an agreement, with Kobolds, to
return a pet they had lost for a key we need to enter a room we found barred.<span
 style="">� </span>Meepo, a Kobold also, was the keeper of this �pet.�<span
 style="">� </span>The pet turned out to be a small white Dragon.<span
 style="">� </span>Quadro and Rask promptly told Meepo he could not keep
the dragon anymore.<span style="">�� </span>In fear of what his fellow Kobolds
might do to him if he did not bring back the dragon little Meepo joined us.<span
 style="">� </span>During the course of the numerous battles with Goblins
and Hobgoblins Meepo and we discovered that he was a sorcerer.<span
 style="">� </span>Apparently his innate magical ability manifested during
a time of great stress and Meepo realized his power.<span style="">� </span>Lucky
for Meepo since it kept him alive during our encounters with the filthy Goblins,
skeletons and other fiendish things of The Sunless Citadel.</font></p>
 
<p><span style="color: black;"><font face="Papyrus"><span
 style="">����������� </span>During these events death was close but did
not manage to claim our lives.<span style="">� </span>At one point I believed
Rask dead but Mewn would not give up on him and she saved him with a healing
potion.<span style="">� </span>That taught me to always confirm life or death
even if it looks like death from a distance.<span style="">� </span>Rask
had been gutted, apparently, but yet a spark of life remained in him.<span
 style="">� </span>Mewn saved his life and so bringing her along proved good
as well.<span style="">� </span>As I said we survived the Goblin fortifications
and the undead and in the end emerged with considerable treasure and a magical
sword that we sold for even more gold.<span style="">� </span>I regret to
write that the shopkeepers son and the others we were asked to find perished
but I am glad to say that we managed to avenge their deaths by slaying a
mad Druid and his twisted undead and transmogrified minions.<o:p> </o:p>  
</font>  
</span></p>
 
<p><span style="color: black;"><font face="Papyrus"><span
 style="">� ��������� </span>So it is that I find myself
in the company of Quadro, The Dwarven Wizard____Rask, of St. Cuthbert___Julin,
a Bard<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style="color: black;"><font face="Papyrus">____Meepo-Goblin-Slayer, 
The Sorcerer____and Mewn.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style="color: black;"><font face="Papyrus"><span
 style="">����������� �</span>As a footnote: Barkin
also a Dwarf decided to discontinue adventuring because it was too dangerous.<span
 style="">� </span>Perhaps he knows best�only time will tell.<o:p> </o:p> 
</font> 
 </span></p>
 
<p><span style="color: black;"><font face="Papyrus"><span
 style="">����������� </span>Once we returned to Oakhurst with our treasure
I decided to give a wayward Gnome my home in the woods since he had no place
to live and had been a captive for 2 years of the stinking-filth that is
any Goblin.<span style="">� </span>I decided quickly that I did not need
my home any longer since the group would be leaving for larger towns perhaps
a city to sell the statues, jewels and art we found in The Sunless Citadel.<span
 style="">� </span>I feel compelled to wander again anyway.<span
 style="">� </span>But my mind stays with home as well.<span style="">� </span>Especially
since my mind cast about for what to put in my 90<sup>th</sup> letter.<o:p> 
</o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style="color: black;"><font face="Papyrus"><span
 style="">����������� </span>I left home 6 years ago in defiance of my highly
regimented life.<span style="">� </span>My father Tenzanier Daerkwood helped
to order my mind and shape my sense of self.<span style="">� </span>It was
his teachings to never give up and to always see good, if possible, in any
situation and to never surrender all of whom I am to anyone or anything.
Those teachings aided me as much as the companions with me during the battles
in the citadel. <span style="">�</span>I feel the need to trance so I will
cease writing for now.<span style="">� </span>I will have to finish letter
90 later.<span style="">� </span>I have some time since we will be in Oakhurst
awhile.</font> </span></p>

<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������������������� I am writing this sitting perhaps 10 feet from an altar and what could
be called an obelisk.�� Total evil is all I can think
of to describe the altar and the dire items we found inside the obelisk.� Mewn tapped on a black drum and the altar grew translucent
and then an eye scanned the room and most of us felt an ill effect.� A great weakness and for those not directly harmed I could
tell it caused a sense of dread.� The drum was one
of the items inside the obelisk.� I don�t know what
the chimes or the small metal ball does but don�t want to know first hand.� We found a scroll as well.� �It
describes a terrible ritual of some kind�this also I don�t care to experience
first hand nor do I wish such things on the world.� I
know evil exists. That hate and violence and other baneful things exist with
a purpose of their own.� But yet I have never felt
a heavy heart like I did when the altar eye �looked� over the room.<o:p> </o:p> 
</font> 
 </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� How the troop arrived in the room with the altar is lengthy but I
can summarize it easily enough.� In Oakhurst I met
with my parents again for the first time in 6 years.� Menyoh
obviously told Tenzanier and Marahnaiol where I had been living because she
wanted to relay a personal message to me about our engagement and knew she
would also give Tenzanier a reason to find me and ask me to come home.� Tenzanier though he is my father would never have come
100 miles to find me own his own merits.� Menyoh, my
love, gave my mother and father a reason to travel and find me and ask me
to return while saving their pride.� After some debate
I agreed to return home and marry Menyoh.� I asked
only that they respect that I wanted to travel to Verbobonc to sell and buy
items we could not sell or purchase in Oakhurst.� My
father agreed.� I told the troop I wanted to travel
to Verbobonc with them but afterward I needed to return home.<o:p> </o:p> 
</font> 
 </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� Along the way we met Grawl, a Gnoll and Tyro who practices the old 
religion.� Tyro was a catalyst to cause our group to
travel from Verbobonc to a place called Homlet.� I
did not care to travel to Homlet on what I thought was erroneous reasons
but none the less we traveled to find Jaroo.� Jaroo
is a Druid like Tyro and is in fact the mentor of Tyro.� Tyro
suspects Jaroo of something.� Tyro could only tell
us that Jaroo was acting strange, keeping things secret from him and �hiding�
something.� What?� Huh?� What?� As Mewn said:� �3 perfectly good questions.� <o:p> </o:p>Tyro could tell 
us nothing and yet somehow the troop decided to travel to Homlet to help
this Tyro person find his Mentor Jaroo and �force� Jaroo to reveal what he
is �hiding� I disagreed with this but I was not heeded.<o:p> </o:p>  
</font>  
</span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� Once we arrived at Homlet Tyro took us to the home of
Jaroo.� A small wooden cabin in the middle of deep woods was our 
destination.� Once at the place Jaroo was no place
to be found.� Tyro decided he was one of the troop
(I think) at this point and continued to follow us even after clearly we
(The Troop) would no longer look for Jaroo.� But it
was I whom was incorrect again as to what the troop would do.<o:p> </o:p> 
</font> 
 </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� On the way to Homlet I made it clear that I would return home if finding 
Jaroo was not possible within a short period�for a human not an elf�or if 
Jaroo was found and nothing sinister was afoot.� I
also asked the troop to accompany me to my home and join in the wedding.� I believed the troop (I include Grawl when I say troop
but not Tyro.� Not yet.) would go �home� with me and
meet my love Menyoh.� Again I was incorrect; I somehow
misunderstood concerning what the troop had in mind.� After
finding none of the troop cared to go with me I parted company with them
and began to make my way home.� I never made it home
or very far from the troop for that matter.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� After parting company with the troop I started thinking about all
of them.� Some of what I thought is during my ride
alone and some of it comes in retrospect after battles that got us to the
altar and obelisk.� But during my time alone I thought
mostly of Mewn and Quadro.���������������������������������
<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">������� �A
human woman raised Mewn. So it gives her an urgency to get some place in
her life in a hurry.� Mewn takes things day-by-day
and �feels� time the way humans do.� She is lucky and
unlucky in this fashion.� Mewn will, I doubt, never
know the peace of moving through the seasons and years.� To
do nothing but enjoy sun, storm, cold and wind, friends and long poems and
stories that last hours.� These things are a part of
me not something I go through. �Mewn fights the seasons
and resists sitting in one place to enjoy time and the spaces between now
and what will come to pass. Mewn thinks in terms of day and night not season
and year.� If Mewn speaks of soon she means in a few
days at best and usually she is referring to hours or minutes.� If I say soon I could mean perhaps several months or even
a year or more.� In this we are different.� I find her humanity refreshing and at the same time know
she is missing out on what has been given her by birthright.� Mewn is a paradox�a woman with a human mind-set but an
Elven body that was made to walk through the years like humans walk through
one room in their home to another room in that same home.� Mewn you have the time to become and be and grow and change.�
You need not rush from place to place and work so hard
to learn things and fit yourself into the world.� Enjoy 
the world.� Sit and watch some of it go by and soon
you will find yourself and know what it is you want to guide your life toward.�
I wonder what she would think if she read this entry?<o:p> 
</o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� Quadro is a Dwarf and a Wizard.� Dwarven Wizard
is not something one sees often.� Quadro has a self-assured
mind set in many ways but is unsure enough of his choices to ever assume
others would be willing to follow his orders.� I thought
Quadro would become the troop leader but after awhile Quadro presented a
tendency to let Julin or someone else lead.� Quadro
is learning quickly how to fight with the axe he purchased.� I have been helping him learn to strike with it while
also serving a secondary goal of firewood for the night.� Quadro is impatient at times but not in a pushing way.�
Quadro is impatient for his own skills and magical abilities
to grow.� Quadro pushes himself to learn new things
like using armor and melee weapons while working equally hard on maintaining
his Wizardry.� Quadro has endeared himself to me in
many ways.� Quadro is teaching me Magic and Quadro
is accepting of others and takes insults or setbacks with ease for the most
part.� Quadro does not let his race and the preconceptions
others have of what a Dwarf should do or not do color how he lives his life.� Grawl is a Gnoll and to be honest dangerous looking and
Quadro used his heart instead of his eyes or any preconceptions of what a
Gnoll is or is not to make a judgement on if Grawl was trustworthy.� Quadro is eager to do battle and with zeal throws himself
into every battle.� Quadro favors fighting hand-to-hand
and saves his spells until he really needs them.� I
feared his hands-on approach to battle as opposed to the detachment Magic
allows him to have in a confrontation would get Quadro into serious troubles
some day.� Quadro chooses not to hang back or let others
protect him unless absolutely necessary.� He is strong
and able but the strongest among us have been terribly hurt. Mewn and Rask
have met death at the door.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� Grawl is a powerhouse and a deadly fighter.�
Grawl
saved Mewn from either a nasty wound or a nasty death.� Grawl
sensed or saw evil Gnolls that were about to ambush Mewn and Grawl killed
one of his own kind with a single swing of his axe in order to protect Mewn.� The troop needs Grawl for his muscle and his senses.<o:p> 
</o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� Rask is willing to meet challenges and martyr himself for the troop.�
Rask is not self-destructive but still he puts himself
into danger when he need not do so in order to heal us or do battle hand-to-hand.�
Rask is rash at times but his faith is mighty and his
power to destroy the undead or thwart the powers of other clerics that worship
evil ends is not only amazing but expected and counted on by the troop.� Without Rask none of us would be alive right now.�
Rask has a temper and when ignited serves to fuel his
faith and power to defeat evil. �Rask has a will to 
live that got him through a near death experience.� Mewn
may have healed his body with a potion but Rask in my opinion forced his
soul to remain in a body, it should have vacated, by sheer force of will.� This will to survive and thwart evil will serve Rask well
in this coming time.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� Julin is the minstrel and though he is brash and disrespectful some
of the time I have never questioned his loyalty to the troop.� Things have gone bad for us and Julin maintains his glibness
and his toothy wits.� His songs give us courage or
strength and I would dare even say speed at times.� Julin
is concerned over treasure but not so much as to ignore life and limb.� I hope?�
I think?� Julin has been lucky.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� As I said I parted ways with the troop and along the road I thought
about each of them and now I write what I was thinking then into these pages.� I sit and stare at the altar and wonder where we will
be led next and will we survive the next few days or even this coming day?<o:p> 
</o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� After parting with the troop I met a man on the road and he told me
he had encountered a group that was insisting on going to the moat house
even though the man on the road told them a Dragon resided at the moat house.� I asked for a description of this group and realized it
was the troop.� I thought they might get killed fighting
a Dragon.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">� ����������� Without knowing exactly what I could do I headed
for the moat house with all due haste.� When I arrived
I saw a blue Dragon that was larger than my horse flying over the moat house
and the troop in disarray trying to battle the beast.� I
rode toward the drawbridge and took 2 hasty shots and luckily hit the beast.� Or not lucky�depends on how one sees it.�
The blue Dragon attacked me diving in and winging past
me.� With a withering strike it nearly threw me from
my horse and blood splattered my face and flew into the air.� I saw my blood explode from the terrible wound and yet
all I could think of was protecting the troop.� I made
a snap decision to fight to save the troop to help slay the dragon or die.<o:p> 
</o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">I put my horse between the dragon and me and fired
2 more arrows.� The 1<sup>st</sup> shot missed and
the 2<sup>nd</sup> glancing the dragon but did not hurt it as far as I could
tell.� The Dragon reached past my horse with its jagged
claws and massive arm and struck me again.� I remember 
firing my bow but then I saw only darkness.� When I
awoke I found my friends had driven the dragon away from me. Rask and Tyro
had healed me.� The troop had stuck the dragon telling
blows.� I arose and followed the dragon outside the
moat house.� Quadro and Julin close behind me.� The dragon roared saying we would all die.�
It expelled lightning from its mouth.� I
dodged most of the blast but still tendrils of blue energy illuminated my
body and a terrible stinging pain racked my bones.� The
brunt of the line of lightning struck Quadro.� I saw
a shower of sparks and what looked like steam and blue yellow mist exploded
from all around Quadro and from his chest specifically.� The
dragon was gloating and I felt Quadro could be dead.� This
en-angered me I went closer to the beast and took aim.� I
struck the creature with the arrows I let loose.� The
2 arrows found home in its neck.� It roared and then
fell dying.� I asked for an axe to behead the creature.� Grawl beheaded the vile thing for me.<o:p> </o:p>  
</font>  
</span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� Quadro was dead.� He lay charred and still upon
the ground.� Mewn was crying and I felt she might give
in to her emotions and become lost to us so I ordered her down from the wall
and to come to the group and help.� I began giving
orders.� I wanted Quadro returned to life and Rask
said he would take care of it not to worry.� Rask left
with Quadro to travel to the temple of St. Cuthbert.� Quadro 
could be raised from the dead but even I knew having heard Yonn (A cleric
and mother of Menyoh) speak of it that raising someone from the dead would
have drawbacks.� When returned to life Quadro would
�forget� some things and be exhausted for some while.� But
I felt Quadro being so full of life would want life again and I hope Quadro
would do the same for me so�<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� Quadro was returned to life and came back the following morning with
Rask whom managed to get a cleric to raise dead.� How
he did this I do not know but it no longer matters.� Quadro
is back and things are set right again.� A number of
other things happened too but all of them so far pale in comparison to the
dragon and the impact it placed upon me.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� I am not a hero.� If I were Quadro would not
have had to die.� I arrived at the moat house and promptly
became mortally wounded. Had it not been for Tyro and Rask I would have perished
too.� <b style="">Okay Tyro is part of the troop.� But I still don�t know him well.<o:p> </o:p> </b></font></span></p>
 
<p><font face="Papyrus"><b style=""><span style="">������� </span></b><span
 style="">So I sit here writing in this book and looking at the sleeping
troop thinking to myself about the overwhelming evil we are choosing to face.� Can we even hope to best an ancient cult that is willing
to die so very handily for their vile secrets and causes?� And just how greater is overwhelming than being whelmed I find myself 
wondering?� Mewn is eyeing me and writing in her journal
as well.� I sense a kinship with her whenever I write
in this book.� Strange I don�t really see Mewn as Elven
for some reason as much as I see her as just Mewn.� She 
is a human trapped in an Elven body.� I wonder what
she would think if she read this entry?� <o:p> </o:p> 
</span></font></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� To the troop: Life is training for us every day.�
Though
failure is possible we must claim the moment.� Become
the moment.� For if we cannot endure today then when
will we?� <o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">����������� Odd, I smile inwardly no one will ever know I wrote this.�
So why did I address it to the troop?� �Because I know I shall no longer be with them one day.<o:p> </o:p>

themselves.� But I fear these mishaps and misunderstanding

was hurt but did not think badly of me for accidentally shooting her.� I made an apology and after Rask healed Mewn everything

<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">��������� Julin said the name of a God and was struck down.�
I
rushed to him and tried to find a place he was injured.� He
was not wounded yet he lay dying. �Rask attempted to
heal Julin.� This had no effect what-so-ever.� After a short moment Julin sprang back hale again and
promptly told us he had spoken to a God and that it asked him some questions.� A ceremonial dagger appeared near Julin with his name
written upon it.� The dagger is all black and I believe
it bodes ill things for the future�at least for Julin if not for us all.� The God Julin spoke the name of is The Elder Elemental
Eye or The eye guy as Mewn keeps calling him.� Better 
to call him anything but his true name since doing so gets you a personal 
audience and a black dagger with your name blazed upon it.<o:p> </o:p> <o:p> 
</o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">��������� We got into a fight with more creatures and things went against us
for a while.� Mewn was ambushed and to make it worse
she was at the end of a narrow hallway connecting 2 rooms. Me, Julin and
Tyro along with his wolf entered the hallway to assist Mewn.� Julin shouted to fall back after seeing Mewn was free
of the creatures that had been attacking her.� Tyro, 
his wolf companion and me covered Mewn as she escaped back to where Rask
and Quadro were.� Mewn needed healing and Rask healed
her while the rest of us maneuvered out of the hallway to get a better defensible
position against our enemies.� Julin was correct fighting
in the hall would hinder us and help the enemy.<o:p> </o:p> <o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">��������� After we all got into position to combat our foes that were regrouping 
and preparing an attack. �I saw Rask move past me and
into the hallway.� Julin and I told him not to go but
Rask attacked the remaining Gnolls.� Mewn took off
down the hallway and assisted Rask.� As it went both
survived and slew the Gnolls.� After the battle I wanted
to discuss leader and focus on how we could better help one another in close
combat.� I was concerned for Rask since shielding Mewn
with magic and fighting tooth-and-nail could be too much on him. I wanted
to explain to Rask that if Mewn is attacked and hurt badly and he, because
of shielding Mewn, could take considerable harm when doing so and if while
he is hand-to-hand fighting he is also hit by his opponent then he (Rask)
could die.� Julin was being very insulting to Rask
at the time we were trying to vote for leader and discuss the hallway occurrence.�
I understand why Julin was insulting Rask to some degree
because what Rask did could have impacted us all.� It 
did not however cause any lasting harm.� During the
discussion about the hallway incident and choosing a leader for our group 
Rask became irate.� Rask tossed away the ring that
he had been using to shield Mewn and walked briskly away saying he would
leave if no one wanted him around or needed him in the group.� Mewn called Rask to come back.
�He 
wavered for a few moments then returned.� Rask chose
to put the ring back upon his finger.� I could tell
Mewn was hurt by what Rask did with the ring.� Mewn
probably felt Rask was throwing about her and his friendship symbolically
as if it was trivial.<o:p> </o:p> <o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">��������� After Rask cooled down Quadro was officially voted leader of the group.�
Quadro is a good choice and I respect him.� But I don�t know if Quadro is ready to give orders that
might contribute to or knowingly cause death?� We shall
see and if I am any judge we shall see promptly indeed.� Situations
are progressing and dangers are becoming commonplace to us.� I don�t know why Rask became angry with me and retorted
that we did not need him?� I entrusted Quadro to Rask
alone.� I trusted Rask to have Quadro Gemini raised
from the dead on nothing more than his word.� I believed
Rask could make it safely back to town though he went alone save the corpse
of Quadro.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">��� I trusted Rask but
now I feel differently.� Rask and I are no longer friends.� I will help him as any member of the group but I if we
are not adventuring and are in town, or more to the point, not in danger
or planning our next move I do not care to associate with Rask.� I have no anger toward him and he did not hurt me with
his words or his actions.� I simply do not wish to
spend time with someone who chooses hostility and threats when calm words
suffice to deal with disagreements.� Rask threatened
Julin and I find that unacceptable behavior from someone I entrust my life
to day and night.� Perhaps his actions were unique
to the one situation and it was all a misunderstanding and not the true Rask?� I will watch, wait and see what is to be proved out where
his character is concerned.<o:p> </o:p> <o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">��������� Now to speak of brighter matters in a few days Menyoh will arrive
in Homlin.� I have sent for her and have no doubt she
will come to my side.� I have known her for 96 years
and want to marry her more now than ever.� To be wed
in Homlin will not be ideal but it will suffice because in my heart Menyoh
abides and in my life is where I wish her to be.� In
40 of her 90 letters to me Menyoh spoke of joining me in my self-imposed
exile and so now it will come to pass.� Menyoh will
arrive in Homlin and I will ask her to marry me.� I
will buy a ring in Verbobonc for her since I sold the one I�d planned to
give her to purchase supplies.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>

Menyoh? �It would be good if Menyoh liked them as well.� I should think she will meet the group and be amazed at
what we have done and gone through together.� Menyoh 
will thrill at the stories Julin, Mewn and Quadro will tell her.� She will also marvel at a Kobold Sorcerer whom has a heart
of gold.� I look forward to the reunion of Menyoh and

down for a bit so I drew a line where I stopped to think for what turned out
to be two hours.<span style="">� </span>I just drew a quick line and walked
off for awhile thinking.<span style="">� </span>It seemed the thing to do.<span
 style="">� </span>I am realizing that we do need a leader or at least to
trust each other.<span style="">� </span>A huge argument came to boil over
some gold and items we had earned during our adventures.<span style="">�
</span>The loot was discussed and Julin and Rask got into serious words over
the treasures.<span style="">� </span>I asked Quadro to do something and
he said he could not because our agreement of how to divide loot was not
written down and signed.<span style="">� </span>I was amazed my word was
not enough to seal the agreement.<span style="">� </span>We are a group that
live together, fight and defend each other against foes that seek our grizzly
death and with all this we cannot agree on what to do with loot.<span
 style="">� </span>Apparently we need a signed agreement before Quadro will
act or before Julin and Rask will trust one another?<span style="">� </span>This
is unacceptable to me.<span style="">� </span>I hoped Quadro would emerge
as true leader of the group but as I see it now things are becoming splintered
and raw.<span style="">� </span>�We� disagree over trifles and while doing
so our lives are endangered by our own hand.<span style="">� </span>As my
father told me on my 100<sup>th</sup> birthday:<span style="">� </span>�Never
agree with the disagreeable if the disagreement agrees with those that agree
to harm you or find ill will with your generosity.�<span style="">� </span>I
never gave that much thought till now.<span style="">� </span>If those I
take refuge with disagree so much that it causes or can cause you harm and
supports even accidentally the agenda of those that wish to undo you then
remove yourself from such disagreements.<span style="">� </span>That is what
I think that bit of fatherly wisdom means?<span style="">� </span>I find
myself longing for home and hearth and to see Menyoh.<span style="">� </span>My
life may well be headed for an early end but I have a duty to the group and
myself to help end the evils that are afoot.<span style="">� </span>For good
or ill the DI has been cast and my fortune bound to people such as I am with.<span

<p class="MsoTitle" align="left" style="text-align: left;"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="">��������� </span>I have decided 
to implore that we have a true leader.<span style="">� </span>I will champion
Quadro for the role of leader.<span style="">� </span>If an agreement can
be made of who will be our leader and the leader shows he/she can unify and
give the group purpose I feel we stand an even chance against our foes.<span
 style="">� </span>If not then I feel I must take actions that I do not care
to take and speak not as a Daerkwood.<span style="">� </span>I, if needs
be, will abandon my fathers teachings of how to relate to those not of my
way of belief and thinking.<span style="">� </span>I will demand things be
done as some of those in the group have demanded things.<span style="">�
</span>Placing myself in a corner and forcing a decision could result in
expulsion from the group but doing nothing until someone dies would be a
greater travesty.<span style="">� </span>If nothing else I can return to
Homlin find Menyoh, journey home and gather help from my family and friends
to thwart the evil forces that infest the temples, dungeons and ruined places.<span
 style="">� </span>But doing this is of last resort and, I pray, unnecessary.<span
 style="">� </span>Perhaps Mewn, Grawl, Quadro, Meepo and Tyro will come
with me? <span style="">�</span>Even if Julin and Rask don�t care to have
a leader or anything else except an argument.<span style="">� </span>Perhaps 
none of them will join me?<span style="">� </span>Though disappointment would
plague me, as I travel home with Menyoh, that my friends did not come with
me or that I left some of the group I must do what my heart whispers.<span
 style="">� </span>My heart whispers for unity and peace with those I trust
my life with.<span style="">� </span>Disagreement and problems arise but
should not lead to mistrust, hatred or such rancorous anger.<span

more able to deal with the threats we face.<span style="">� </span>Embracing
mistrust, anger and hatred will bring us to a lonely, quiet place indeed,
our grave.</font></p>

in my mind to what my family has taught me of behaving and teamwork and accountability.<span

I am with is concerned.<span style="">� </span>We have goals and no plans
of how to achieve them.<span style="">� </span>In fact I believe some of
the group does not know what it is we are trying to do or uncover.<span
 style="">� </span>Where will we go next?<span style="">� </span>Julin wants
to go to the main temple proper.<span style="">� </span>I think in our present
state of disarray that is a bad idea.<span style="">� </span>We cannot fight
fanatics and those devout to the cause of returning a dark god to Oerth and
be unfocused and unfriendly to one another as we have been.<span
 style="">� </span>I keep calling us a group and say �we� but honestly we
are a group of individuals with goals that range from noble to noxious.<span
 style="">� </span>What is the answer?<span style="">� </span>Is there more
out there than I have been handed?<span style="">� </span>Certainly adventurers
exist and can be found that are wiser, better equipped, and more experienced
at dealing with such evils than us?<span style="">� </span>I know a hero
or 3 must be walking the land as I write this in search of some grand and
noble cause to undertake.<span style="">� </span>If this land depends on
only this group then I despair at what shall become of all good-loving folk.<span
 style="">�� </span>Mayhap The Circle of 8 shall become involved?<span
 style="">� </span>Bigby and Otto are spoken of with generous regard as good
souls at the School of Tal.<span style="">� </span>My father Tenzanier is
an enchanter and my mother is a Sorcerer and psionic.<span style="">� </span>I
would not dare call them powerful but strong comes to mind.<span
 style="">� </span>Those of the School of Tal are or have been adventurers.<span
 style="">� </span>In fact Deven Arkay takes a sabbatical every other year,
so I have been told, to go on certain journeys.<span style="">� </span>Deven 
has come back with strange items or large gems and after such a sabbatical
Deven Arkay always donates considerable gold to the small temple to Rao and
gives gems and most his strange items to the wizard school.<span
 style="">� </span>Deven Arkay is actually, now that I think about it, a
celebrity of sorts.<span style="">� </span>Arkay is 35 years older than I
am yet we have much in common.<span style="">� </span>My father use to have
him over to our home for meals and Arkay would play with my younger brother
and me.<span style="">��� </span>Humans found Deven Arkay at age 18 wondering
around a burning wagon and crying for his parents.<span style="">� </span>I
remember the story well.</font></p>

taken in by humans at age 18 and cared for by them for 36 years until a wondering
bard, the brother of Geggen Amakiir found Arkay and told him of his father

Deven returned to the Kron hills and his remaining Elven family.<span

gave him but in all other ways acts and reacts as an Elven man�for the most
part.<span style="">� </span>Arkay never did find the bandits that slew his
father and mother but it is a closed chapter in his life as now.<span
 style="">� </span>Remembrance is strong upon me and though the night groans
toward morning I care more to write about the past than to trance or think
of the present or my future.<span style="">� </span>I could write so much
more about things I have done and seen and those I was close to in childhood
I have grown away from now but what good does it do me?<span style="">� </span>Mewn
said the point of the journal was to write in it and look back at it later
and see how things changed in my life.<span style="">� </span>As I write
now I see that things have changed indeed.<span style="">� </span>My childhood
friends are teachers or mercantile owners or true scholars.<span
 style="">� </span>Kunu is a scholar.<span style="">� </span>She is the first
girl I ever kissed.<span style="">� </span>Menyoh is the third and XioXoe
Ulalume was the first woman I ever saw naked.<span style="">� </span>XioXoe
is beautiful to this day but her passions are for old tomes and hidden or
forgotten things.<span style="">� </span>Kunu often helps XioXoe decipher
books, scrolls or tablets.<span style="">� </span>Once Xio disappeared for
7 years and returned with slabs of rock from Blackmoor.<span style="">� </span>Not
long after Kunu and Xio began translating the slabs the curious slabs were
absconded.<span style="">� </span>Who took them is a mystery.<span
 style="">� </span>It is talked about often and a story of some intrigue.<span
 style="">� </span>The story will have life breathed into it by one tale
or another for ages.<span style="">� </span>Of course one account is terrifically
out proportioned and involves a harrowing battle with those shadowy figures
that took the slabs. A battle never occurred but Xio and Kunu did see shadowy
figures.<span style="">� </span>Both women were disabled by poison from darts
that the mysterious intruders used upon them.<span style="">� </span>Of course
not before Kunu could cry out and alert the night guards of the library.<span
 style="">� </span>This call for alarm by Kunu is rumored to be all that
saved the scholars from death. However the poison paralyzed them for a short
time and after this effect ended nothing else ill came of the attack.<span
 style="">� </span>Since that day Kunu or XioXoe have never seen such mystery
bandits again or had such a tale to tell that would not be boring except
to the bookish or some sage.</font></p>

of life so I knew that this time, perhaps never again, she would return when

wants to find her family and this is a driving goal and so raising her from

your family still and you have a renewed chance to live again.<span

your death.<span style="">� </span>I will help you Mewn in what ways I can.

and her attitude dark just after her return to the living.<span style="">�
</span>Though only gone one day this event darkened her spirit.<span

fears were short lived and unwarranted, for the most part, because Mewn conquered
her inner demons involving her death and return to life.<span style="">� </span>Or
at least she took hold of her darker emotions and subdued them to the place

for Quadro and Mewn.<span style="">� </span>We found no other treasures in
the Moat house and so we traveled to The Temple of Elemental Evil.<o:p> </o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="">����������� </span>We reached a
town that was no longer a town at all but the wild things that grew did not
completely destroy the mark of a place once civilized.<span style="">� </span>Buildings
still stood though hard pressed not to fall in or be overgrown by whimsical
nature and her eternal handiwork.<span style="">� </span>Ill foreboding crossed
over me as Quadro entered a building.<span style="">� </span>I stood in the
doorway ready to defend him but from what I could not have said then and
yet guarded I stood.<span style="">� </span>After a moment something surreal
came into focus.<span style="">� </span>It was like a man yet not.<span
 style="">� </span>An apparition of sorts shimmered and with a sword struck
Quadro whom had his back turned to the apparition.<span style="">� </span>Quadro 
called out in pain, staggered then fell rigid.<span style="">� </span>I saw
the apparition, a ghost, shimmer away and then reappear.<span style="">� </span>Hastily
I ran in and grabbed Quadro from off the floor.<span style="">� </span>I
pulled him into a corner of the building.<span style="">� </span>Others of
the group were coming in and taking up weapons against the ghost.<span
 style="">� </span>Julin shouted that only magical things could truly harm
the ghost creature.<span style="">� </span>What Quadro taught me I now used
to protect us both from the undead evil.<span style="">� </span>I hefted
Quadro upon my shoulder and cast Shield.<span style="">� </span>I knew Quadro
was hurt and if this ghost struck him again I believed Quadro would be slain
by its malevolence.<span style="">� </span>Julin shouted, a resonating sound
burst forth and the ghost was struck soundly by the energies Julin loosed.<span
 style="">� </span>To no avail we fought it.<span style="">� </span>Even
the power of Rask to cower down or destroy undead was of no use.<span
 style="">� </span>The brightest light ever I have seen, as yet, came from
the holy symbol of St. Cuthbert and the ghostly evil remained undaunted.
Not beaten by it but unable to harm it each of us knew fighting it would
end our lives if we remained.<span style="">� </span>We retreated to the overgrown
road and found that again Julin was correct about the ghost.<span
 style="">� </span>Julin recalled that ghosts could only travel about in
certain areas and thusly only be dangerous in the place it was fettered to.<span
 style="">� </span>The ghostly man could not leave the building and what�s
more the weapon it was using melted away upon crossing the threshold of the
house.<span style="">� </span>It could not come after us and so we backed
away and left it be.<span style="">� </span>I will return one day and destroy
the ghost with magic but for now it gets a reprieve.<span style="">� </span>Nulb
is an evil place indeed and as so it is befitting it reside so close to The
Temple of Elemental Evil.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>

Quadro was appointed leader of our group.<span style="">� </span>Julin argued

for Quadro.<span style="">� </span>I assume that Julin will continue to have

or blood but with the casting of a spell that put thick mist within the room.<span

I believed to be the familiar of a hobgoblin wizard.<span style="">� </span>I
drew blood and the creature clicked with a loud and dismaying sound.<span

illuminated the fog and Julin cried out. To my amazement he kept singing

to see within the fog I tried to kill what enemies outside the mist that
I could see and to some effect I succeeded.<span style="">� </span>Then I
heard Julin, in the mist still, cry out.<span style="">� </span>His singing
stopped and I knew things were starting to go badly.<span style="">� </span>I
ordered Rask to go into the mist and find Julin.<span style="">� </span>Rask
hesitated then agreed.<span style="">� </span>A short while after that I
saw Rask and Julin at the edge of the mist.<span style="">� </span>I yelled
for everyone to get out of the mist and come to my voice but those still
inside the mist were having trouble fighting the enemies.<span style="">�

though I wounded him badly.<span style="">� </span>Injury after injury was
weighing me down as well.<span style="">� </span>I traded strike for strike
with my foe but yet he tasked me.<span style="">� </span>My resolve fell
and I felt I might die.<span style="">� </span>A pounding in my chest coupled
with anxious dread overcame me.<span style="">� </span>I saw Mewn behind

magic.<span style="">� </span>Meepo did as I asked even though 3 dogs attacked

magic strike out and I heard his grunts of pain as those damnable dogs tore
into him.<span style="">� </span>Just then a rousting roar comes from the
edge of the fogy mist still in place and I knew Grawl was dealing death and
this dealt me hope.<span style="">� </span>Tyro was yelling something and

 style="">I am writing this time for no other reason than having myself disciplined
to do so.� I don�t have the time to write much of anything
because of the fact I have named myself Sheriff of a lawless town.� When we entered Rastor I found it to be unacceptable.�
The streets of Rastor are mud and the housing is substandard
to what I have always known.� People are apathetic
about their lives in Rastor.� Why?� The group was heading to Rastor in order to locate The Temple of All
Consumption when a band of Orcish people attacked us�they wanted everything
we had.� We did not want to give them anything.� Julin tried to negotiate but they would have none of it.�
The Orc wanted us to show him our power.� Julin struck him with his minstrel magic and I fired an
arrow into the Orc.� After this we were free to pass.<o:p> 
</o:p> </span></font></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">�<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">��������� Rastor is a place in need of law and order.�
I
cannot simply let it be as it is.� After talking to
Hammerstrong I felt even more that something needed to be done about the
thievery and other ill things.� Especially since Hammerstrong,
a Dwarf said he�d lived here and so had his family before him and Rastor
had always been just as it is now.� The people of this
town don�t seem to care to make their life better.� I
did not know if anyone would want a Sheriff or laws to be followed and thusly
a better life.� But I have to try to help the people
of Rastor.� Something in me spoke to me about this
town so I felt I could not disregard my own inner thinking just to make life
easy for those I adventure with and myself.� Taking
on such a monumental job of bringing law to a town and attempting to change
the status quo of deep apathy and smug disregard for anything that resembles
authority is highly dangerous.� I know this and still
I have made up my mind about it.� I asked Julin to
pen me an announcement and so he did.� I hung the announcements
around town and waited to see who wanted me as their sheriff and who did
not.� I expected no one to show but three men did meet
with me about the town.� The beginnings of a jail is
in the making as is a garden near the jail and Tyro is gathering seedlings
and wild animals for the cause of making Rastor reputable.<o:p> </o:p>  
</font>  
</span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">�<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">��������� While in town we discovered that The Temple of All Consumption has
wizard directed lightning towers that could too easily kill us all.� The direct approach is impossible so we will attempt to
find, hopefully find, hidden tunnels that lead to the dreaded place we seek
to infiltrate.� I know that what we seek to do is deadly�people
have died yet I feel ever more that what we do means little.� I know it means something though yet I cannot see the
light at the end of the tunnel concerning such mounting evils.� I am of 2 minds involving this current set of situations.<o:p> 
</o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">��������� I want to bring the people of Rastor a better life.�
Is such a thing up to me?� No.� No is my answer yet I pursue trying to make Rastor better
all the same.� Why?� What is
happening to me?� My father would call it righteousness
and he would say I am dedicating too much of myself to one goal or task.� It is folly.�
My father would call
it folly.� So would my mother.� I
think Menyoh would tell me to let the town be and come home to the Kron hills
and start a family.� What do I want?� I don�t know what my life plan is now.�
I thought
it was a life with Menyoh and our children we would have one day. But now
things have changed so much I fear making Menyoh wait is too much of a strain
on even our relationship.� Menyoh, I know, has fear
that I might be harmed or that the quest I undertake will consume all my
time and she will be left behind.� Her fears are not
without merit. Dismayed as I am about it I think Menyoh may be correct.� Am I an adventurer or a Sheriff or a man who wants only
the comforts of a close family?� I do not fool myself
when I write upon these pages and say I want to be all these things.� There is not time in the day and night to be all these
things.� Yet I adventure with the group and with deep
determination seek to make Rastor better.� All the
while hoping against hope that Menyoh and my family waits for me and understands
what it is I am trying to help accomplish.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">�<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">��������� Menyoh was upset that I sent her back to The Kron hills with the letter 
of introduction but agreed to leave as quickly as she could to deliver the 
message and to return home where my family can protect her.� I think her good will toward me will not hold if I don�t 
return within the year. Yet I could not guess at the time such endeavors
might keep me from The Kron Hills and so I could not give her the answer
she asked me for.� �When will you return home?� I could
only respond by telling her when our quests concerning this manner are done.� Menyoh did not like such an open and emotionless answer
but it is and was all I could say. <o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">�<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">��������� I also have 2 concerns involving the group.�
Tyro
is 1 and leaving Grawl to take the brunt of what I started is the other.� To speak of Grawl 1<sup>st</sup> he is a strong fellow
and I asked him to stay behind and oversee the undertakings in Rastor.� Though Mewn is our scout I felt the group stood a better
chance of finding the hidden tunnels we need to locate to enter The Temple
of All Consumption if I assisted them.� I chose to
go with the group though I have even one more obligation to fill and no time
to do it.� It is for a greater purpose of saving lives
and thwarting dark purpose so the choice is clear.� Grawl
appears fierce; he is fierce, so this shall work in his favor in my absence
from Rastor.� I doubt anyone will quarrel with Grawl.
<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">��������� Tyro is my 2<sup>nd</sup> concern.� Tyro threatened
Julin.� Tyro, the wild told us that his family was
slain by Goblins.� A goblin surrendered during a fight
and Tyro would not call off his wolf companion.� Julin
commanded Tyro to call off the wolf or it would be killed.� Tyro did not take this too well and said he would not call off the
wolf and instead ordered it to attack anew.� Rask stepped
in and pushed back the wolf to save the cowering Goblin.� During
this interval Tyro threatened that if Julin tried to kill his wolf he would
kill Julin.� This to me is a more serious thing than
how Rask acted some time back when confronted about engaging the enemy in
the hall when the group was pulling back to defend and get in a better offensive
position as well.� Rask never threatened to kill anyone
at all but Tyro did and I find this unacceptable.� Quadro
handled the situation between Julin and Tyro that also included Rask peripherally
with tact I did not think Quadro possessed.� I am glad
Quadro handled it so artfully yet if this kind of situation arises again with
Tyro, the wild it will be me who handles the situation�I will not be as tactful
or artful as Quadro.� Defenseless beings of any sort
barring undead I will not kill except under very extreme circumstances as
occurred at The Sunless Citadel. �I do not advocate
blind vengeance directed toward a race.� I hate Goblins
as a race in so many ways and while hate is a strong word the hate I feel
does not rule my heart and mind.� I still see right
from wrong through the hate I have for the Goblinoid race.� I never liked Kobolds either until Meepo so I now hold a place in
my heart that I could accept any race into the group and into my life as
a friend.� Meepo said that we did not kill him and
gave him a chance and we should give the cowering Goblin a chance too.� The group except Tyro agreed immediately to give the Goblin
a chance to live and change its ways. �Of course with
us each step forward sees a setback of some kind.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">�<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">��������� I was unhappy at the time it took for everyone to take Grawl back
to be raised from the dead.� When Quadro died I set
in motion the way in which Quadro could be returned to life as quickly as
possible.� When Mewn died we immediately went back
to town to return her from the dead.� But Grawl was
left to lay unattended after his most terrible death.� It
was apparently more urgent to investigate and find treasure or other enemies
or what-have-you than bringing a fellow friend and adventurer back to life.� I will never understand this reasoning and sudden change
of group attitude about those that die and what is to be done about it.� The group I believed had the unspoken rule of returning
to life via Raise Dead those that died as soon as possible.� I was wrong about what the group would do once more or
in this case not do.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">�<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
 
<p><span style=""><font face="Papyrus">��������� The Temple of All Consumption is, surely, very deadly a place to go
and we will need every advantage we can get if we enter the tunnels.� I now wish as I sit here in the deep woods that I had
not asked Grawl to stay behind.� We may need his might 
and with my asking him to stay behind we will not have such might.� My mother once told me:�
�Each decision
one makes is never as selfish as one thinks. Others sometimes countless others
are affected.� My mother is good at saying such things and then looking at
you a certain way as to let you know she not only believes what she has said 
but what she said has also been lived by her.� Unlike
my father my mother is a mystery to me.� Mostly she
is a reserved, unassuming and timid housewife but on rare and strange days

she is to me. This rarely seen inner fire makes me wonder what kind of life

that I chose not to follow my dream of a family.� I

most people do not want to risk their lives or property but none the less
want Rastor to be a better place.� With the likes of
Tuuraug Urkrt, Jardeth and Tymerian my hopes are up that Rastor has a chance
to be a place I would want to live.� Perhaps I am more
of a frontier pioneer that I thought.� The idea of
forging homesteads and building something from what once was chaos or for

Bead.<span style="">� </span>I knew it could kill me but using the Bead was

conviction that Rask might need to leave the group if he keeps on making
threats whenever something does not go as he sees fit for it to go.<span

best thing that can be done.<span style="">� </span>Tenzanier told me once:

if it is wrong is worse still.�<span style="">�</span></font></p>

Julin and Quadro and thus Quadro and Julin wanted to protect the objects

Julin attacked Quadro for taking one of the objects, this if before Quadro
got charmed, from the alter.<span style="">� </span>Quadro and Julin wrestled
Rask to the ground and took away the object.<span style="">� </span>Rask
started verbally attacking those of us that did not help him when he called
for help.<span style="">� </span>I explained my reasoning�no one was getting
badly hurt and Quadro and Julin where not making their own judgements�that
Quadro and Julin were not making their own decisions in the matter but rather
the charm-spell was making it for them.<span style="">� </span>Rask did not
agree and became angry and threatened not to help us if one of us was in
trouble.<span style="">� </span>I told Rask that he would leave the group
if he acted like that and did not help us when it was warranted.<span
 style="">� </span>Rask then asked me if he went for one of the objects again
would I support such a move.<span style="">� </span>Julin and Quadro were
still charmed so I told Rask such a decision was completely up to him.<span

it happened I heard Menyoh and Mewn scream then noticing no danger and seeing
that the Dwarfized Rask was the object of fright I laughed out loud for the
first time in 6 years.<span style="">� </span>I realized the only time I
ever laughed like that was around Menyoh.<span style="">� </span>Then it
came to me that I have been terribly somber and reserved because I have been
away from Menyoh.<span style="">� </span>Menyoh you are the light that guides

<p class="MsoSubtitle" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><font face="Papyrus">The prophecy Rask possesses might not actually
have anything to do with him if he remains a Dwarf.<span style="">� </span>I
wonder if such a change from Rask being human to transforming into a Dwarf
would change the prophecy?<span style="">� </span>Or does the prophecy only 
seem to be about Rask?<span style="">� </span>This is interesting to think
of since prophecies are tricky and malleable and altogether strange lots
with exceptions being the rules and every rule having some obscure exception.<span
 style="">� </span>My mother explained prophetic works like this: �Create
an abstract piece of art such as a painting that is objectified and quantified
by each viewer and perhaps by each new viewing by the same observer.<span
 style="">� </span>This is most like prophecy except prophecy is much less
clear and altogether more nebulous.�<span style="">� </span>Of course I am 
paraphrasing what my mother said while being, I hope, faithful in spirit concerning
what she told me.<span style="">� </span>Perhaps Rask would benefit from
sessions with XioXoe and Kunu since they deal with obscure languages, prophetic
works and magical text as a matter of course.</font></p>

father or learn of their fate by some means.<span style="">� </span>Quadro
must continue working until he �earns� the love of a woman.<span

only rich but also known through the land as a �legend� of sorts.<span
 style="">� </span>Tyro needs find his heart, <b style="">though he knows
not that he has lost it, </b>and learn compassion and I dare say how to love.<span

she loves�not knowing she has found it because the Elf has never told her
so�and thusly her place in this world.<span style="">� </span>So I am fortunate
enough to travel with two souls that possess a heart of gold.<span

something.<span style="">� </span>The something is time, that thing he once

<p class="MsoTitle"><font face="Papyrus">��� Meepo was killed.� Rask raised Meepo from the dead.�
Still Meepo died and the enemy we have been battling was responsible.� The
leader of the air temple was trying to recruit troops in Dyvers.� The recruiting
process did not go well however since we killed most all his new troops and
in fact managed to slay the air temple leader himself.<br>
<br>
��� I was able to track some enemies down river.� I chose to go alone to
stay focused and because humans and Dwarves need sleep and Elves simply don�t
sleep�.we trance for 4 hours�and so can work with little rest.� I found a
warehouse and a door in the floor that was well hidden.� This tracking effort
took hours but I returned, meditated and was ready to go when the rest of
our group was ready to leave.� We battled some enemies at magical darkness
was used against us again.� An explosive blast burned up the floor causing
Julin and Meepo to fall through the burning floor.� Quadro barley escaped
the fall and Mewn and I used a door in the floor to escape the blaze.� This
is how Meepo died.� But our adventures are not what I want to write of�not
exactly.� I more want to speak of the conversation Quadro and I had in private
and the direction I think Mewn is going in her life.� And lastly I will write
about my own feelings about remaining with the group. <br>
<br>
��� I told Quadro something deeply personal and also told him that I saw
Mewn kill �in cold blood� an incapacitated enemy.� Quadro did not seem to
care; Quadro did not care actually, about what Mewn did.� I was fine with
it for a few moments and then I started thinking and I realized it was wrong
to kill like that.� Quadro says it goes to the greater good and so to better
benefit the world killing some very evil individuals no matter how it is
done is okay.� Or at least killing them when they cannot defend themselves
is okay to Quadro and I think fine with Mewn too.� I don�t know what everyone
else feels but I will be calling their beliefs into question as well Mewn
and Quadro will be asked what they feel in front of the rest of the group.<br>
<br>
��� <br>
��� I have to ask everyone what he or she feels about killing the defenseless
even if they are evil and vile and trying to destroy the world.� I have my
own dark thoughts as well that must be dealt with.<br>
<br>
��� Mewn exhibits a �It no longer matters� attitude where killing and I am
afraid being killed is concerned.� She has been returned to life 3 times.��
Each time she is returned from the dead Mewn becomes less like the Mewn we
met in the tavern and more like a stranger to me.� I see the changes.� I
notice so much more than the others do about Mewn or for that matter anyone
in the group.� My vision is clear concerning the attitudes of the group and
what will be said of the questions I will ask.�� I can predict what will
be said.� I thought I did not know I see now that I do know what each will
say or believe.� Julin and Meepo will be against the killing of the defenseless
evils.� Rask will grudgingly agree after some efforts by Mewn and me.� Tyro,
the wild is �uncaring� enough to be swayed that it is for the best to kill
the evil beings as easily as I might blink my eyes at any given moment. Quadro
will either stand by what he told me in the hall in private during our talk
or he will change his tune.� I think he will not change his tune about killing
incapacitated foes.� But if Quadro does then I will speak with him again
alone and we will come to agreement on things.<br>
<br>
��� I lost my wife and when that happened I felt true loss for the first
time ever that I have lived.� The feeling was dark and empty and yet filled
with bitter cold rage and a deep sinking feeling.� The sinking feeling haunts
me still just as the cold heartedness I carry weighs me down.� I spoke to
Quadro about my trepidation.� Quadro told me, in so many words, it was okay
to hate the terrible beings of The Temple of Elemental Evil and it was just
as fine to kill them to prevent the end of the world or at best terrible
wars.� Many innocent people would die during wars waged against a powerful
army of The Temple of Elemental Evil and so if evil grows strong the innocent
suffers.� If their dark god escapes his prison the world suffers.� The only
answer is to fight fire with fire.� To wage unforgiving war upon those that
will not forgive.� To destroy forever those that wish destruction upon all
good folk is what is called for during this dark time.� I cannot see another
way as I sit here writing and looking at Quadro, Mewn, Julin, Rask and Meepo
and Tyro.� No other way but to become a horror to horrors.� Quadro has told
me he trust me and that I am the least impulsive and most careful of the
group.� I find this to be wrong.� I let my wife go to a place of overwhelming
evil and she was slain.� I could not save Menyoh from the horror that befell
her.� I can never make my bad judgement or their heinous acts right but I
can work to do my best and never let such feelings cloud my thinking again.�
Love and caring and a sense of well being when I was with Menyoh made me
forget the perils we face and in forgetting I lost my one true love.� For
this I will repay the forces of The Temple of Elemental Evil and all those
that shelter them or voice their cause.� They will pay for what they have
done.� They shall pay with their dearest blood.<br>

To put a fine point on it Julin saved us all.� We found some members of the
water temple and engaged them.� The battle was going very well until some
clerics did a cooperative spell and brewed up some sort of lightning magic
that struck us terrible blows.� If this were not bad enough the minions of
the water temple called out and two large lobster like creatures lumbered
toward us, summoned by the call of the amphibious humanoids of the water
temple, and began attacking with their powerful pincers.� The lobster like
creatures could paralyze with their tentacles and I found that their strength
was far greater than I could hope to overcome.� I was snatched up and held
by one of the creatures.� I could not get free.� Quadro and Rask fell victim
to the paralyzing tentacles and Mewn was captured by a hold person spell
of the lightning brewing clerics.� Meepo was hurt badly and Tyro was dismayed
at the death of Luke.� With nearly the whole group hindered or simply removed
from doing anything via paralysis or spell it was Julin who used his magic
to turn the tide in our favor.<br>
<br>
��� Julin struck out with thunderous sound using his magic to crush one of
the lobster creatures that held me.� This act saved my life.� I was able
to strike out at the lightning brewing clerics and harmed mortally one of
them.� Julin hurled more sound into the downed cleric because we had seen
twice before that one or the other cleric healed the one we felled and again
threatened us with spells.� Those clerics made a frightening team but in
the end they could not stand against Julin and his sonic attacks.� With luck
and the exhaustive bravery of Julin we survived.� I survived.� As I said
Luke, the companion of Tyro was slain.� Tyro used his magic to reincarnate
Luke after the battle.� Luke was reincarnated as a human.� Luke being human
now was naked and it had not mattered that Luke had no clothes when a wolf
but as a man it did matter.� Julin gave Luke a robe to wear in order to maintain
modesty.� I knew humans were hairy but I had no idea they were so laden with
hair as they are.� How uncomfortable all the hair must be.<br>
<br>
��� We have faced many threats while inside the temple and I never know what
might attack next.� I have been writing that I will take vengeance upon my
enemies and slaughter them and that the evil beings will know my name�yet
I never commit.� I don�t know what is wrong that I do not take the actions
I write about.� I did not write about my wedding and now there is no point.
I did not prove to my father I could live my life without magic, this I failed
at entirely, since I am using magic Quadro taught me and adding magic to
my arrows with the arcane arts taught me by Celeste.� I did not stay and
make Rastor a better place�I left that to Grawl.� I have not done many things
I profess I will do.<br>
<br>
��� Quadro says I am the most level headed and clear thinking and careful
of the group but what they don�t know is I am driven by hate and consumed
by fear.� I have all these inner demons that have awakened in me.� The world
is a scary place to me now.� I am weary of the evils of this world and weary
of the world itself.� In fact, for me, the world has ended as far as I am
concerned.� All I have left is the pursuit of destruction of the denizens
of The Temple of Elemental Evil.� The evils of that place ended my world
and I will be a part of ending their world for them.� To save a world I no
longer belong in or care to belong to must surely mean I either have a deeper
purpose of good and am following that or perhaps it means I am losing myself
in malice and hate.� Perhaps all the emotions I have left, those that drive
my existence anyway are at their core rotten?� Quadro is rousing and Meepo
is already awake______I will have to finish this entry another time.�� Now
I must go to war�.<br>

��� ��� I have been through horrific times since I met Julin, Quadro, Rask,
Tyro, Meepo, Mewn, Grawl and Barkin.� In all that time it seems only Barkin
and Grawl had the sense to quit before what they faced changed them forever.�
I have been changed, so has Mewn, into something wholly other than what we
were when we began fighting The Temple of Elemental Evil.� The others have
changed too.� Julin is more aggressive and Quadro has blended techniques
of magic and fighting style, as I have never seen before.� Quadro has managed
through necessity to mesh arcane magic with axe and armor.� Meepo has learned
some unique magic through intuition and self-discovery.� Rask has come to
terms with the prophecy being close to culmination.� The fellow who gave
Rask the prophecy resurrected Rask and told him that the time to face the
Elven-vampire was at hand.� Rask was taught some techniques and told some
things but I don�t know how they will help him against centuries old evil?�
Rask seems confident now as never before that he can defeat the Elven-vampire.�
I am not so sure such a thing can be defeated by him but I am not Rask nor
am I a part of the prophecy he is written into.<br>
<br>
��� Large creatures able to make sound that can sheer stone and pulverize
nearly anything attacked us.� In the battle these completely blind creatures
managed to unerringly seek out and strike telling blows, as we stood helpless
in the pitch black of the cavern that was their home.� First Julin fell and
then Meepo.� I called for a retreat and grabbed Julin from the unforgiving
ground he�d been slammed into by the sonic breath weapon of the terrible
creatures that with ease were becoming our undoing.� Quadro said he thought
we could defeat them and in the meager light of the continual flame ring
I wear I saw his face and knew Quadro would not retreat.� Quadro, Tyro and
Mewn formulated a plan to kill the creatures but of them the most foolish
by far was Tyro, the wild.� Tyro and his wolf raced to battle the beasts
and confronted the creatures head-on.� It was but moments before Luke and
Tyro was slain.� By this time I managed to get Julin out into the hall and
through a door the monsters could not fit through�I hoped�as far as I could
figure.� Our swan song was begun.� Quadro fell and lay dying and I could
do nothing but watch by the pale light of my wedding ring.� Mewn still stood;
I could hear her, yet I could not see her.� For some reason as I have yet
to guess Quadro, before being struck down, cast invisibility on Mewn.� The
creatures being �blind� were nonplused by such a useless effort to escape
detection. <br>
<br>
��� I ordered Mewn to save Quadro since he was our leader.� Mewn saved Quadro
and then saved Meepo as well.� I ordered Mewn to close the door to the expansive
cavern that was the creature�s lair but then a blast of sonic energy struck
me and I fell to the ground unable to do anything more.� I was unable to
help Mewn close the door.� I don�t know what happened from there�well not
for awhile I didn�t. <br>
<br>
��� I lay between dying and living for hours before I roused awake.� I awoke
Julin, Meepo and Quadro.� I still felt that my life was �thinner� than it
should be but I knew I would live.� Mewn was no place to be found and after
tracing her footsteps and finding the sword of Air lying at the door I knew
what had happened.� The creature though quite large had been able to reach
through the open iron door and drag Mewn away.� My order had been her death
and her blood I must accept as on my hands�yet�<br>
<br>
��� I looked at Quadro and repeated some of the words he�d used to keep me
in the group when I told Quadro my heart was growing dark.� �Numenarh you
are the least impulsive, most careful of the group and I trust your judgement
most of all.�� That is very close to what Quadro told me in private and I
spoke his words back to him in frustration and anger.� I yelled for retreat
and in all the time Quadro had known me I had never done such a thing.� Quadro
did not listen and instead gave hope of defeating the beasts that were already
crafting our doom.<br>
<br>
��� Rask, Tyro, Luke, and Mewn were dead and to be sure of what was their
fate Julin recalled tale on Mewn.� Julin described in grizzly detail how
the monsters devoured our friends.� Quadro admitted he�d made a mistake but
admitting it did not get our friends back from the dead.� Without a body
the steep price of True resurrection would be impossible for us given the
meager resources at hand.� We would have to sell everything we had to true
resurrect our friends.� Just as things were the most bleak I had known them
since the death of my wife Julin proposed something rather daring and possibly
suicidal.� Take Tulian�s eye to a temple of Moradin and ask for our friends
to be resurrected in �exchange� for Tulian�s eye.� Of course a deadly curse
lay upon the diamond involving a wasting disease to any whom removed it from
the resting-place it�d been given.� I volunteered to be afflicted but Quadro
spoke up and said he would carry the eye and that he would bare whatever
curse lay upon the diamond.� I did not argue with him.<br>
<br>
��� The Dwarves received us readily and were ecstatic to have the diamond
returned to them.� We were given hot meals and many thanks.� In the bargain,
as well, our friends were returned to life�except for Tyro and Luke.� Tyro,
the wild did not return when called from the afterlife and since Tyro would
have the say in what to do about his dead companion Luke remained among the
dead as well.� All together again save one.<br>
<br>
��� I was born on the first day of Patchwall and my birthday passed almost
uneventfully.� Mewn gave me a figurine that was a likeness of both Mewn and
Menyoh.� The figurines were holding hands and both managed to appear to be
looking up at me.� An inscription read that I would never be alone but the
gift made me feel the most alone as I ever have that I can remember in 117
years.� I have great warmth for Mewn for giving me the gift and know the
purpose was completely for the purpose of making me happy on my day of birth.�
But I felt coldly alone because Menyoh is gone forever and I don�t know when
Mewn might die and like Tyro never return to the world of the living.� Tyro
died and the spell to resurrect him was unsuccessful.� What makes Mewn different
than Tyro and why did Tyro not return?� After the death of Tyro, the wild
the group met Drak.� Drak is a druid like Tyro but has a bear instead of
a wolf as a companion.� Drak healed Mewn when she was badly hurt so I instantly
trusted Drak on the basis he healed someone without question.<br>
<br>
��� I have decided to write my father and tell him of the death of Menyoh
Daerkwood.� I will write a separate letter to the family of Menyoh about
how sorry I am about the death of their daughter.� I have to accept what
happened to me and my love and get real closure involving her death.� This
is the only way I can be a whole person again�be Numenarh or at least not
be a brooding and lonely Elf.� Hopefully after all this that has and will
happen I can be the Numenarh of old.� Mewn and the rest of the group help
me feel I can go on but if I don�t get out of this destructive mood and deal
with the loss of Menyoh in earnest I feel I might become cold hearted or
worse.� So I will deal with her death and learn to deal with my new life
and the life I will live after we beat the living nine-hells out the Doomdreamers
and all their horde of horrors.� <br>

��� I begin this entry just after having reread all the other entries before
this one.� I have learned something and it came at a time, as many things
do these days, when I least expected it.� What I have learned about myself
is the beginning of the end of the darkness I harbor in my heart.� I have
fumed at the evil temple dwellers and wished death and doom to them and the
creatures that inhabit the temple areas.� I have not simply wanted justice
or to save lives I have wanted to bring them pain and suffering and wanted
to be more like them than like whom I really am.� I forgot the kind of Elf
I am and the kind of upbringing I received.� I forgot who Numenarh Daerkwood
is and for some time began acting unlike myself.� No one noticed for some
while because I am stoic and standoffish by nature�but even I could not hide
the darkness in my heart.<br>
��� <br>
��� We were battling Salamanders and in the battle the creatures used fiery
swords�their swords are aflame apparently only while they hold them�and cunning
tactics to confuse us.� In the battle Rask was slain.� I killed the Salamander
that slew him but I felt horrible for not being able to save him from dying.�
I was standing beside Rask and he was killed and I could not prevent it.�
This caused a terrible shadow in my soul.� I knew it would take weeks to
go back to Nyr Dyv to have Rask true resurrected and I also knew Rask had
been saving coin to buy magical items to battle the Elven vampire the prophecy
speaks of.� I knew Tyro was dead and never was going to rejoin us so I said
we should use Tyro�s money to Resurrect Rask and save Rask the currency he�d
been saving.� This is not what we agreed to when our group was first formed.
Julin became upset with me and Quadro agreed I was wrong in wanting to use
the money Tyro left behind to pay for Rask and let Rask keep his coins.�
With Rask dead and endangering us all I began to act in an irate manner.�
Or more to the point far worse than Rask.� Actually my behavior was childish,
dangerous and a display of near utter madness.� In writing now I should not
even compare it to Rask�especially since Rask has improved his ways a great
deal and his attitude with it.� I threatened my friends and snapped at Mewn
for no reason and these are but a small number of things I did to provoke
arguments and challenge the group.� In the end I broke down because I realized
suddenly what has been wrong with me.� I have been dark-minded and filled
with such rage and sitting on the floor sobbing I came to a stunning conclusion.<br>
<br>
��� I hate you Menyoh Daerkwood.� My hatred and anger at you Menyoh has given
me my dark attitudes.� And not admitting it brought me to my knees.� Only
after I broke down did I realize what I had been denying all this time.�
I denied that your death wounded me so and I denied that your letter you
wrote and gave in secret to Julin wounded me.� I denied that I felt cold
anger that you professed to love me so very much but would not return to
me after your death.� So many people do not have the resources to bring back
a loved one whom has been lost.� It is well within my bounds to have returned
you to life Menyoh and yet in your letter you tell me to go on without you.�
You tell me to not let death stop me but to continue on no matter what even
though you choose to remain lost to me. <br>
<br>
��� I could not fathom why you chose to write a letter in secret to Julin
explaining your choice not to be raised from the dead and why you could not
have the mettle to tell me yourself?� I will never know I suppose.� I bravely
went on after your death and pretended I was not overwhelmed with guilt and
loss at your death.� So many things have happened to me since I left the
Kron Hills and I know so many more things both joyful and grim will happen
to me as I go about my life.� Considering the choices I have made I hope
the joy will outstretch the grim but I have doubt my life will be as good.�
But even if many things are hard and painful for me, and our group, I know
that protecting the innocent and thwarting evil such as we have battled is
for a greater purpose.� I am a hero Menyoh and I am going to start acting
like one.� I have changed so much and learned so many things about evil and
horrors to chill the marrow that I cannot in good conscious let such horror
stand in the world.<br>
<br>
��� I have learned things about courage and friendship and the very meaning
of good has been redefined in my mind.� I will strive to best the foes of
darkness wherever they may be.� When the foes of the Temple are beaten and
the Doomdreamers thrown down I will continue to seek out evil and evildoers
in other places.� I feel it is my duty and my calling to walk the land and
help those that cannot help themselves.� I will return to Rastor as well
and make good on my promise to bring law and order to Rastor.� I will never
again ignore the purpose I am born for.<br>
<br>
��� Menyoh I am still angry you did not return to me.� But now I can heal
and after some time I know I can let go of the pain and anguish and eventually
the guilt I feel for not being able to somehow save you.� I only hope Julin
and the others can forgive me for my actions and words___________________________________<br>
<br>
� I will be looking forward to each day now where just a short while ago
before my revelation I dreaded each new day.� I feel like I am a part of
the world again�my hopes in life are toward the future�and as such I will
protect what I am part of from the Doomdreamers and their hordes of evil.<br>
<br>
��� I was at the lowest point in all my life and feeling like, at that time,
I could not go on living.� I wanted to give up and die.� Then I heard Mewn
use Zephyr and I heard loud clanging of metal on metal.� I arose and moved
to help Mewn.� The rest of the group came to her aid as well.� We entered
a room of utter horror.� Hanging on hooks and other impaling devices were
the decaying bodies of several different races.� Some of the flesh had been
torn away or removed and some flesh remained.� The bodies were mutilated
and it was obvious hours of torture went on in the room.� In the room where
such carnage was committed, with glee, a bloody bed sat silently as a testament
that the being responsible for the butchery also slept in the room.� Julin
recalled tale and discovered a Gnome was responsible for the debauchery.�
A badly wounded and tortured person was found in the room as well. I gave
him a healing potion and we used the healing wand on him as well.� Panicked
and afraid at first he eventually realized we were not here to harm him and
accepted our help.� After the sickening room and the magic that helped us
determine who had committed such violent acts we all agreed to hunt down
the Gnome and slay him.� Julin even hinted to the tortured man that we would
torture and dismember the Gnome.� I doubt we will but in this case I think
it is justified.<br>
<br>
��� As I write I find that I have only 8 pages left after this one.� I have
all but filled up this little journal book.� So when next I reach another
place to purchase another journal book I will.� I bought a small �diary�
in the beginning because I thought I would have few things to write about.�

</span>I am near the end of this book and only at the beginning, I fear, of
dealings with the Temple of Elemental evil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For the first time since we have battled them I feel today we dealt them
a telling blow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even when the Air
Temple was destroyed and the air Sword captured I didn�t feel like much had
been done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am glad we survived
and we could continue on and I know we hurt the forces of the temple but I did
not feel we taxed them enough for their plans to be halted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Today was different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
powerful set of individuals was sent to destroy us including a beast called a
Grey Render.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Render was
magically enhanced with glyphs and runes and it flashed with magic during the
battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro and Nox, someone I
have never mentioned before now I realize, took on the Grey Render.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox is a Githzaeri and he and Vit also Githzaeri have been helping us as
of late do battle with the Temple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Gith have come to see if the threat is warranted and since they quickly learned
the temple is very threatening Vit returned to his home and Nox remained to
gather more information and along the way help us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Grey Render attacked furiously and that combined with a fireball and
Flamestrike thrown at us taxed us to our brink.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The battle was going hopelessly against us so we decided to
retreat�when we saw we could not get away however it became fight and win or
fight and die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We made a
choice___________<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Quadro and I could have escaped and left everyone else to their own
devices but this is not what happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro
said it looked like we were going to have to reengage the enemy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meepo was cut off from escape and Mewn against orders chose to continue
fighting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So Quadro and I entered
the fray once more hoping to turn the tide and win the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro went after the Grey Render and I came in close to deal with the
spellcasters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My arrows struck true
and just as I was about to reposition myself and fire more arrows I heard Quadro
exclaim: �Die you big gray bastard.�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
magical hammer Quadro held struck a terrific blow against the Render.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A moment after the creature recoiled from the hammer�s blow Nox struck
out with a furious onslaught using only his fist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The rapid snapping sounds let me know Nox was doing serious damage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Render as big and as magically enhanced as it was swayed and
stumbled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Render touched a
glyph and healing energy knitted its wounds then it touched another glyph and it
was all but completely healed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Seeing
this I let 2 arrows fly and both struck the Render, 1 struck the arm the other
landed in its side, angering it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
wasn�t sure I helped them or just enraged the huge beast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox and Quadro in tandem struck from each side of the beast confusing it
and in the end all the Render could do before Quadro and Nox ended its life was
sway and stumble to the symphony of hammer and fist.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The beast fell dead.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As Quadro and Nox was battling the Render, before it died of course,
other things were happening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn
managed to get trapped and Meepo was on the ground but still alive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I let fly 3 arrows and felled 3 guards but I could tell the guards were
only there to die, run interference for the Clerics, so devastating spells could
be cast against us unanswered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So
much for the interference, I smile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn
pulled the bead of force from her pouch and throws it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The bead harms many of our enemies and encapsulates one in a bubble of
force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The force blast of the bead
of force sent shock waves through an already unconscious Meepo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The blast killed Meepo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
hurled my bead of force as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>2
More enemies were encapsulated and others fell to the second shock wave.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro and Nox by this time had wailed upon the Gray Render sending it
crashing to the floor, dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From
here on the battle went our way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox
used magic to shatter the armor of an enemy soldier and Mewn kept attacking with
Zephyr, her sword of air, to full effect and in the end with song, arrow, metal
and magic we took victory from the jaws of defeat.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We now own the Sword of fire. We have the enemies guessing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They sent a Grey Render, a half-fiend, soldiers and several Clerics with
magical enhancements on them I have never seen wielding 5<sup>th</sup> level
spells and none of them will return to report to their superiors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They don�t know what we are capable of and I am sure they sent this
entourage to quash us and yet it is they whom are quashed.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We have made the decision to return to Verbobonc but I will stay in
Rastor with Nox and someone new who may join us in the fight against the
Doomdreamers.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The person I speak of now that I am in Rastor is Malicai.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He is a sorcerer and proud of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Malicai
talks almost constantly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I noticed
that he also keeps calling my name out as if I am across the road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>�Numenarh!�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or �Hey�Numenarh.�<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This in fact is going on now while I am writing in my book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I decided to buy a journal here in Rastor but they don�t have anything
suitable so I will have to wait till later to get a new journal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I wish I had________ Malicai challenged me to an archery contest and at
the moment I don�t have my bow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro
took my bow and my rapier to Verbobonc so he could enchant them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Malicai is calling again saying something about getting an ale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Malicai has gone off to get a drink�<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mewn found Malicai while she was scouting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Malicai was beaten up and chained to a wall and Mewn set him free.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I shall have to talk to her about that later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But on a more serious note Mewn told me she has been feeling strange.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I really wish I had gone to Verbobonc since Nox is not much company and
Malicai is way too much.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Malicai is offering that we both go get a drink apparently he never made
it to the tavern.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I will go with
him and finish my journal another time. _____________</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-tab-count:1"><font face="Papyrus">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The trip to the tavern was event filled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Malicai decided that a random Orc had attacked him and caused him to be
imprisoned where Mewn found him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Malicai
knocked this Orc out and nearly killed him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I arrested Malicai for this and he ended up being a prisoner in the jail
I helped build in Rastor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Orc
survived and Malicai only need stay 2 days in jail since I gave the Orc 12 gold
for his injuries and trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Orc luckily seemed fine with the outcome.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
would have demanded more but I guess this particular Orc did not care to get too
involved with the whole legal side of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
no permanent harm was done to him I guess he just wanted to get away from
Malicai and enjoy the rest of his day.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact with Malicai in jail I will go for a long walk in the
woods.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Malicai is out of jail now and he keeps asking if we can go to Verbobonc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I keep saying no and he keeps asking.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am writing the rest of this in Verbobonc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I did not go to Verbobonc because Malicai kept asking and asking to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I went to Verbobonc because Julin contacted me through magic to tell me
that Quadro had been arrested for murder and Mewn was wanted for murder and I
should Teleport to Verbobonc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
suggested the magic shop owner of Rastor might have a scroll or Teleportation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was able to get a scroll for free due to a fortunate bit of luck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A young man whom had been tortured by the evil Gnome we still have yet to
slay is someone the magic shop owner cares about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I got the scroll for free.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
was not sure I could cast it properly and even though I knew Malicai could do it
with ease I attempted it because I don�t trust Malicai.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I took Nox and Malicai with me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
was able to magically send us all to a holy temple in Verbobonc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I felt very good about myself for accomplishing such a difficult spell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Once in Verbobonc I found that Quadro had killed 2 people trying to help
Mewn escape from guards whom wanted Mewn for murder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I tried to get Quadro out of jail but the officials would have none of
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They wanted him in jail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The magic shop owner vouched for Quadro however saying that he had put a
Dominate Person spell on Quadro and could control him almost like a puppet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I didn�t care for this but it got Quadro out of prison and able to help
me track Mewn.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mewn had turned evil because of a cursed stone she�d been carrying
around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She told me she�d been
hearing voices and I told her that if she started not feeling like herself to
tell me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not tell me she
was feeling like a cold-blooded murderer so I am hoping she misunderstood
��not feeling like herself�� I chose not to go into the particulars of
it but we tracked down Mewn and jailed her for her crime.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was discovered that the magical stone cursed Mewn and Malicai said if
we broke it that it might set her free of the evil and allow her to be Mewn
again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Malicai was correct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The ordeal was devastating to Mewn and she broke down in tears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I stayed in her jail cell all night to comfort her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox stayed by our side as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
am beginning to trust him as much as I do Quadro or Julin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have not figured out if Nox or Meepo gets stranger looks but I think
Nox does if I had to hazard a guess.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Rask purchased Raise Dead scrolls and returned both guards Quadro killed
to the living.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That and it came to
light Quadro was trying to stop and hinder the guards and not willfully kill
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn was found to be
incompetent at the time of the murder since a cursed stone drove her to become
evil and ultimately kill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because
of Rask and a little forgiveness on the part of the guards and lots of
explaining Quadro and Mewn were set free.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro
was released much more reluctantly than Mewn yet still the authorities let him
go.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I let Mewn read my Journal so she would know how I feel about some
things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think she needs that
connection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn needs to know this
ongoing battle with evil is and has been hard on me too and if she sees what I
write and how I feel on paper it will be more real to her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She allowed me to read her journal as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I think she might like Julin a little more than as a friend
or at least she is, perhaps, open to possibly getting to know Julin better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mewn has a fondness for me I did not know she had either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I think she sees me as a brother or very close friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro says we will be staying in Verbobonc for a little while so I will
scribe the Mage Armor scroll into my spellbook.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Malicai challenged me to a �duel� by striking me with a glove across
the face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He says I insulted him
and his honor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Human beings are
strange creatures or more correctly this human being is quite strange.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Malicai walked about 40 feet from me and started to cast a spell so I
shot him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His spell was thwarted by
my attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The magical energies
started to take form and then the magic fell apart in a small glowing shower of
sparks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Malicai badly wounded
swore: � You will see me again some day Numenarh you can count on it.�<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When he said that I had a moment of hesitation where I wanted
to finish him off before he skulked into the darkness.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I almost fired but did not take the opportunity to kill
Malicai since he was defenseless and fleeing, as best he could, from me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The reason I hesitated and considered attacking him was I know Malicai is
a sorcerer and a Dragon disciple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
means he will after a time take on many characteristics of a particular type of
dragon.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I told Malicai during our stay in Rastor that I lived in the
Kron hills and even the town my family resides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But I can�t think of his parting threat now. Soon we will reengage our
most lethal enemies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro
enchanted my bow with shock and made my rapier magical also.</font></p>

</span>I have come to the end of this journal and so the next time I write it
will be in the new journal I have purchased here in Verbobonc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So few words written to tell such a grand and terrible tale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No one will ever know what we have been through and what we have faced
except those of us who have been in it from the beginning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Those of us who began at the Sunless Citadel know most of all how much
the other has endured and overcome and how very much some of us have lost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But each of us has also gained things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Strength, courage, knowledge, magic, insight and greatest of all trust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>

</span>Quadro, Meepo, Julin, Rask and Mewn these people whom I have been with
from the onset are the ones I consider the group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They are the ones I consider above my own life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We are as family in my mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
the battle involving the Gray Render and the ordeal of returning Mewn to whom
she truly is I have begun to change how I feel and think about the group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I feel more at home in the company of the group than any place I have
ever been.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Papyrus">Quadro is the armored
spellcaster who is always looking to find a way to be just that one bit more
armored.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By spell or item or battle
technique he searches to thwart or escape the attacks of his enemies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Julin is the helper and the voice of reason, sometimes, when things get
particularly bad.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>His attacks are quick and sure and he is the true diplomat
and most always the face of the party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Especially
if we need to sell something or get information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meepo is the heart of gold and the trusting soul but with a harder edge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meepo has gained so much magical insight I can hardly believe it is still
Meepo sometimes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn is the scout
and our stealthy attacker.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She is
excellent at attacking from a distance and in ways or from directions the enemy
cannot guess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She is the wild card
of the group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes effective
and deadly and sometimes not as much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
has an undertow sense of humor be it dark at times it still befits her wily
personality. She still possesses the mindset of a human being and this is in
part her charm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It certainly is
where her wit comes from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Humans
have savvy I have found and a willingness to learn anything that might help them
no matter the cost or time needed to put into the work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mewn often learns things with lightning speed and in this she is more
like a human as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Humans rush
about learning multitudes of things faster than Elves do and all at once as well
it would seem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then there is Rask.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He is the healer and a fighter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rask
has grown to be able to strike with death dealing effect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His healing magic has grown to match his destructive powers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rask has grown as a person and with all the changes it is hard to figure
what he might accomplish next but whatever it might be I am sure it will be
devastating to the enemies or a great boon to us as a group.<o:p>

Shadows that attacked us without mercy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rask
drove may of them away by channeling the power of his deity thorough a holy

most to defeat the horde of undead creatures that nearly took our lives. <span style="mso-spacerun:

</span>Julin was sick with weakness so Quadro polymorphed Julin into a Minotaur.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was the only way to keep Julin on his feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Not long after the battle in the coffin room we came upon a huge magical
circle that clearly was very powerful and after some divination spells we
discovered the circle, scribed with sigils and glyphs, held conjuration magic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Conjuration magic summons things or brings things into being and so a
circle such as this would probably summon something.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro took it upon himself to step into the circle to see
what would happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>2 huge
spider-like creatures with razorish forelimbs appeared from out of purple and
green light.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly they were
summoned by the break in the circle, by Quadro, but Quadro had no control over
the monstrous beasts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The creatures
spoke telepathically:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>�Die.�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And then the 2 huge nightmarish creatures proceeded to try and kill us
with all due haste.<o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Quadro ordered us to concentrate on one creature at a time so we could
kill one quickly and then surround the other and slay it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The idea in itself, since we outnumbered the spider-like
horrors, was not a bad one but the creatures proved to be invulnerable to fire
and all but immune to my arrows and to most all other physical forms of attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I would fire an arrow and the arrow would strike true but a moment later
the wound, no matter how terrible, would heal over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox could do nothing to the creatures with the fire sword and Mewn and
her air sword did little but anger the beasts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Only the sonic attack of Julin and any purely magical force harmed the
creatures in a lasting way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the
battle went of Quadro cast haste upon me and even though I fired arrow after
arrow the creatures were not really harmed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro attacked the spider-horrors head on hoping to kill them with
magic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro got too close and one
of the razorisn forelimbs struck his shield and a rending could be heard as the
razor limb slashed through and ripped away Quadro�s shield.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Julin also had his armor destroyed by the same type of
attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn had her magical armor
torn down the front and ruined.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rask
cast Dismiss to banish one of the creatures but it had no effect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was then that Rask began to glow with a dark radiance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have never seen such dark energy before from Rask.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even his eyes were alight with liquid black magics.<o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Rask reached out and touched the spider-horror and gouts of black energy
surged from Rask and into the spider-horror killing it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rask had slain the beast with only a touch.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>For a moment Rask did not seem himself and I could tell the
surge of magical power surprised him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
surprised me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When I turned around
I saw that Julin was dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
other Spider-horror killed him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Julin
was no longer the Minotaur so that is how I knew he was dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Polymorphed beings revert to their true form when slain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After considerable work the other spider-horror was slain as well but it
took a great toll on our resources to win the battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Julin is dead and in order to return him to life we will borrow gold from
Meepo and Rask will Planeshift us in the morn to The Seven Heavens.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I was amazed he could do this but he said he was welcome back
anytime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So he offered to take us
to the first layer of the Seven Heavens to resurrect Julin and to give us
respite from the traveling we would have to do in order to reach a place that
could True Resurrect Julin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn
does not want to go because she says it is like being dead or something but I
told her we were all going.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think
it will do her some good and I want to see this Seven Heavens Rask talks about
because it makes me curious.<o:p>

</span>I am writing all this while on watch for the night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Julin, his body anyway, is lying motionless not too far from me and I
can�t help but think that my �charmed� life is ended.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I have seen tragedy after tragedy from the death of Menyoh to
the death of the entire group and one point or another but I and Julin have
always survived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We always managed
to survive no matter how bad it got or who else died we always made it out
alive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I save Julin and Julin saved
the group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We in essence seemed
charmed to survive no matter the chaos or evil that came against us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was unspoken that we look after one another in battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Many times I have let arrows fly to help Julin because I felt obligated
to help him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When a foe pressed me
and I was afraid I might be badly hurt or killed I still helped Julin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thing is Julin did the same for me many times and for the rest of the
group as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When I first met
Julin he was not like he is now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Julin
has grown into a hero that chose to sacrifice himself so we could win a battle
against the spider-horrors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Julin
died saving us all and as long as I live I will never forget what he did for me
today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Julin gave me another day of
life, handed it to me, by laying down his own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The charm is ended and the road ahead is unclear and fraught with dangers
that cannot be foreseen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am the
only member that has been with this group since The Sunless Citadel that has not
perished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I feel that with the
death of Julin a kind of quasi-magical luck has been broken, the charm, not just
for me but for the entire group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Things
just seem harder and I know that even though we will get Julin back, he
definitely wants to be True Resurrected, it will not be the same.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Julin may not be the same.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Things
change.<o:p>

</span>I had to stop writing abruptly last time because men trained in the way
of the Monk and Trolls attacked us during my watch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was startled by a noise and just in time was able to warn the group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Had everyone still been in trance or asleep it would have gone badly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fight was somewhat difficult but we won without exhausting ourselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Fights like that don�t come along too often though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Usually we are hurt, in need of healing and tending those that have
fallen so they do not die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We are
growing all the time in strength and knowledge (knowledge is just another type

</span>We are heading toward my home as I write this I am sitting upon ground
that once I traveled over with Deven Arkay and Wilstway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Myself, Mewn, Nox, Quadro and Meepo have returned to Oerik.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rask, Drak and Julin have remained in SIGIL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Julin was returned to life in the Seven Heavens but soon all of us went
through a portal and traveled to a wondrous place called SIGIL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This place is most impossible to describe and it is unlike anything I
have ever seen or even been told about in a fairytale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is at once beautiful and dark and helpful and puzzling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>An enigma within a conundrum and a question I don�t even know how to
ask and if I asked it would it have an answer or would the answer itself be some
impossible riddle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a good
way to explain SIGIL for those that have never been�I suppose?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But none the less just remember if you get lost it might mean you could
never return to your home or to anyplace you ever knew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was very careful to not get lost since certain �<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">keys</b>�
are needed to go to and leave SIGIL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">key</b> might be water from the Silver
Sea or a bit of sand from a certain place or a feather.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In my case it was a feather that took me to Celene and since I knew that
my home bordered the Faerie Kingdom of Celene my mind was set to travel home. I
am glad most of my friends decided to travel with me to my place of birth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We will be meeting the rest of the group in Rastor.<o:p>

</span>Drak stayed to do some research of some sort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rask stayed because�?�and Julin stayed because he joined the Sensate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Sensate as near as I can tell are a group of usually beautiful, if
not scantily clad�if so scantily clad too, people that experience vast amounts
of what life has to offer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
group Julin joined seem to think (I think) if you can do it, see it, act it out
or go there then do so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Very much
the thing our Bard Julin already does so he will be right at home in such a clan
of people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Julin cannot leave until
his initiation is done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently
all of us needed a break from the constant dungeon crawling we have been doing
because once in SIGIL everyone went his or her own way without any real worries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I think we needed to be away from each other too.<o:p>

</span>When I was 80 Deven Arkay and Wilstway took me and my brother from our
home because of an evil man named Ennaker.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ennaker wanted to make my father suffer for stealing his treasure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In truth the treasure was a religious icon of St. Cuthbert and my father
turned it over to a temple of St. Cuthbert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ennaker a human adept at evocation magic swore vengeance not only on my
father but also on his family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ennaker
swore he would kill everyone my father held dear and then at last after such
suffering leave my father to a ruined life but not until he severed his hands
from his body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ennaker was evil and
insane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a very bad
combination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So Deven Arkay and
Wilstway (A Gnome female of dubious nature) a cunning, cute and dangerous sort
protected my brother and me in the woods on our journey to Celene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My family was to meet us at Ralph�s home if they had dispatched with
Ennaker and all was well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My father
and mother teleported to Ralph�s living room the second day after we�d
reached Ralph�s. <o:p>

</span>My father was burned and my mother was cut across the arm and had several
large bruises on her face and neck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
scariest thing for me in all this was that my father held the severed right arm
that I could only guess was Ennaker�s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
got sick and had to go upstairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
brother stayed and painted on his canvas and sang to himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ennaker was killed and my mother and father had killed him together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My father kept the arm for reasons to this day I do not know and have
never asked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I will never ask.<o:p>

to report of the death of Menyoh to her family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It must be done however and so I will tell of her bravery and death and
show them the letter she wrote me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
letter will help them understand her wishes to not be returned to life better

</span>Hishn the name of my town actually means Speaking wolf but the term went
out of common usage about 400 years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Strangely
enough this is also about the time the town made its name only Hishn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>About 400 years ago Hishn had a much longer name: Hishn-Daranuel
Ot�Hama.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The entire name means
�Speaking wolf self-rules this home.�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daranuel
technically means (Ruler by right of birth or ancestry) and Ot use to mean (that
or this) but it stopped being used before my father�s father was even born.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Papyrus">And Hama means home or resting-place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But Hama was never widely accepted and was considered slang more than
anything�bad slang at that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So
the name became just Hishn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
what is known as progress I would guess?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
can thank my mother for the history and word lesson.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She must have told me 100 times about how Hishn got a more proper name
and how she liked the �less proper� one a great deal more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such was my childhood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
seemed every minute must be about some lesson or thing to know or fable or
metaphor or how sometimes something may look like a good idea until you trance
on it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My house was and still is a
place to learn first and live second but I miss it and at this moment I miss the
learning as much as the living I did in Hishn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro seems ready to get going so I will have to put quill to paper some
other time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I will have to warn
Quadro that the Kron Hills can be dangerous since we will be traveling into
areas today that are not often set foot upon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mewn is putting water onthe fire and Meepo is finished meditating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I wish I could sit and order my mind for just a few minutes and have an
arsenal of spells like little Meepo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wishing
never makes it so�<o:p>

the forces of The Temple of Elemental Evil and at last we have defeated Fire,
Earth, Air and Water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We managed to
destroy all their altars as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
ended up making Mewn unhappy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
destruction of all the altars nullified the power of the elemental swords.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Zephyr, the air sword has lost all magical enhancements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox having the Earth sword didn�t seem to care and Julin was only

unhappy and expressed some mild depression over the nullified weapons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I for one am glad the altars are all smashed since they serve to promote

discuss what magic is best to do battle with inside the Fane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

and about 60 feet across.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
octagonal shaped and across from the door that closed a few moments after we all
entered the octagonal chamber is a large staircase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have foreboding about attempting to climb the steps little alone
venture onward.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course almost
dying 3 times will do that to a person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
did it to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am afraid now, as I
have never been before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am not
sure I can deal with my fear but not knowing must mean I am wrestling with fear
not that fear has beaten me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I hope
that is why I feel so shaken and not that I have lost my nerve and haven�t
owned up to it yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I owe Quadro,
Mewn, Julin, Nox, Meepo, Rask and Drak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not
sure why I wrote their names down but it made me feel better seeing them in
print just now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Actually Drak is
gone on some self-appointed mission to gather Druids to the cause of defeating
The Elder Elemental Eye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We needed
him in the Octagonal chamber against the Arrohawks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We need all the help we can get and I have to face facts we have all the
help we are going to get�Us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just
us our group is what will be in the Fane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I don�t know if we can handle this but I will see it to whatever end
this quest comes to�No matter what.<o:p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Earlier
before we accessed the Fane door Mewn was captured by the �Queen� of <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The Water temple after we
asked her to attempt a bluff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn
pretended to be a member of The Water Temple and her bluff proved to be less
than believable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A race to save
Mewn from torture first and death later began.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>During our search Nox flew me about the place as we searched room to
room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As we opened each door, if
there was no Mewn we kept moving, in a blinding hurry Nox kept saying: �No
Mewn move on.�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After a few
minutes I gave up and started yelling her name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mewn did not return my call for her and I began to get dejected.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Before we could find Mewn, go flying and searching as I
explained, we had to kill the �Queen� and her minions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The �Queen� ordered us to surrender and Nox asked a little
apprehensively:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>�How fast can you
get in there to help me?�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
responded:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>�Like a flash.�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With just my word Nox being bestowed flight by magic sailed into the room
and dropped a feather.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A feather
that turned into a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">huge</i> boat as it
headed for the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox was 10
feet in the air and the boat came crashing down onto the �Queen� and her
shocked cohorts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was shocked too
about the little white feather turning into a boat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The �Queen� and her minions regrouped as we all followed Nox into the
room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meepo hurled a fireball into
the wreckage of the boat Nox so ironically delivered against our foes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</i></span></font></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><font face="Papyrus">Well anyway,
during the beginning of the battle the �Queen� whom I buried an arrow in her
shoulder decided to pay me back with a spell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She polymorphed me into a sheep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
wasn�t long before Meepo used Dispel Magic to revert me back to Elven Numenarh
but during the short time I was transmuted to a sheep I realized how Mewn and
even our enemies must feel when such a transformation occurs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A feeling of uselessness and loss along with depressive fear is the only
way to describe it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Thank you Meepo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
killing The �Queen� and all her cohorts then Nox and I flew about looking
for Mewn.<o:p>

</span>Nox and our search-----After some time and even after I began calling for
Mewn as loud as I could we couldn�t find Mewn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I kept trying to track her and the trail kept going cold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Finally after some more flying around Nox set me down near a door and I
called out for Mewn again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
time there was an answer but not the one I hoped for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A voice said from behind the door:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>�We
have her and if you open the door we will kill her.�<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I said to let her go because if they killed her Nox and me
would kill them anyway and if we had to force our way in we would kill them too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We told them to release Mewn now and we would let them go free. Then Nox
started a count down�10 he said and I followed with 9 and then Nox said 8 and
I said 7.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During this count down to
take our offer or face consequences the men behind the door said we could not
threaten and antagonize them that way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
kept counting: 5, 4, 3, 2�and then the fellows, there were only 2, yelled out
that they would release Mewn and so this is how we got Mewn back and how 2
scoundrels got to see another sunrise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was another thing altogether getting her magical and other equipment back�but
we managed.<o:p>

</span>Dire Apes-----Mewn sneaking to find out what a noise was came back to
tell use that large apes blacked our path.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was decided that Mewn would try and sneak past the Dire Apes to see
what was beyond their lair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rask
placed Sanctuary upon her declaring Mewn all but guaranteed of safety via the
spell.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn was not safe and she quickly needed our help.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Everyone rushed into the fray against 7 Dire Apes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>During the battle Mewn was knocked down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I could tell she fell in such a way that meant she was terribly hurt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>During the battle Nox engaged an Ape 1 on 1 and the beast managed to get
hold of Nox.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Ape grabbed Nox in
much the same way Grawl was attacked just before it ripped Grawl open.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox twisted around as the claws pulled at him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Blood splattered and I could hear tearing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Gashes appeared as the Dire Ape tried to rend Nox apart but Nox avoided
death though he did fall prone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
battle carried on with Meepo helping with his magic and Quadro dealing serious
damage to the beasts.<o:p>

</span>As the last Dire Ape fell I ran to Mewn to heal her with the imbued
healing magic Rask gave me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
smiled at her and told her she was fine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn
looked unhappy, scared and worried all at the same time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She nearly died and I understand her attitude but it frightened me that
she was skittish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not long after
she was the same Mewn again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox
survived the Dire Ape attack mostly because of his mental disciplines and
training as a Monk�Rask and his healing magic restored Nox to health.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With the Dire Apes dead we discovered that what lay beyond their lair was
of no particular importance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>________________________<o:p>

</span>In the Octagonal room we battled 4 Arrohawks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The creatures could hover perfectly and still attack from the air with
precision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The creatures were hard
to battle and finding a strategy against them did not work for us.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I was knocked to the floor even after I dealt horrible wounds
to one of the Arrohawks it just kept on going.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rask cast Bears Heart and that gave me strength to go on just for a
moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Arrohawks attacked
again and I was rendered unable to respond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I felt myself being swallowed up by darkness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was like I was not really in my body anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I felt like I was outside in the darkest place I have ever been�then I
saw Mewn standing over me with the healing wand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She touched me again and I felt stronger and my wounds closed but were
not healed completely yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I�d
taken a deep wound to the neck and my chain shirt was covered in my blood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then another Arrohawk came from some place to attack me again�I was
struck hard before I could get my bearings and decided on what to do�with a
vicious strike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Moments later the
Arrohawk that struck me threw lightning at me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This occurred more than once and I fell once more as the thin string of
lightning stole from me the last of my resolve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>All I know is Mewn pulled me from that place where there is only a
whispering �nothingness?�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This

</span>Or maybe I just wish it were important for good or ill so that I might
focus on it rather than my near death?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An
answer I have it is questions I need.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
know the truth I suppose but writing it down will make me face up to something I
am not prepared to consider. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But
not writing it down denies the very reason for the journal.<span style="mso-spacerun:

know the truth and the truth is I am being called by �__________� the
unknown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The whispering is from
somewhere, someplace and the answer is the whispering calls me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Questions:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why, who or what,
where from and why me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These are
but a few questions I have.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Other
Questions: Was it a trick of my mind or was I hearing Mewn and the others trying
to save me? I was between life and death so it�s possible I heard them but
thought it was whispering from some distant place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The unease I felt could have been the subconscious fear of death.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As I write in my journal I keep suggesting other reasons for
the whispering. Other than what I know to be the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I know the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
just don�t know why I know.<o:p>

</span>The battle with the horde of The Elemental Evil and of cultist is an
older story than the one I have been writing about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Evil has arisen before and because of such banality heroes were born or
made and one of these heroes was Thrommel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Emridy Meadows is the place the hordes of evil were crushed by forces
from Furyondy, Veluna, Verbobonc and other realms assembled to meet the immense
forces of evil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The great hero
Thrommel was the military leader of these forces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The defeat of the evil I write of occurred in 569 CY.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If this was the only accomplishment Thrommel ever helped achieve he would
have been known as a great man and his story would have been told again and
again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A hero among heroes who
commanded such mighty forces in cooperation against dark-hearted souls is by far
enough of a task to be known as hero. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>But
unifying Furyondy, Veluna and Verbobonc was to be his next goal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thrommel was to marry Jolene of Samprastadar and in doing so unify many
realms against the villainy of Iuz.<o:p>

was lost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thrommel and his fate

</span>We were also told Thrommel was within our reach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Julin became excited at hearing this and wanted to at once rescue
Thrommel by first destroying him, as a vampire, and resurrecting him so that
Thrommel would once again be human and untainted by the evil-mantle of
vampirism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I agreed that the plan
be moved upon at once.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time

</span>The decision was made quickly but with much doubt by those of us, Julin
and I, whom wanted to go with all due haste.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even I who said we should go without waiting another moment had doubts
and told everyone that perhaps all of us would not survive and in doing so
declared I would willingly give my life to return Thrommel to Furyondy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro and Rask were the most opposed to entering the vampire
Thrommel�s lair but with the vote narrowly in favor to attack the vampire
without rest�<o:p>

</span>Varachan told us how to avoid set traps and at a certain door we were to
say �The dark god watches.�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
order to avoid a certain magical trap.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Julin
forgot what door to speak the words and before I could stop him Julin opened the
door and triggered the magical trap.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Large
black tentacles sprang from a glass table in the center of the room and attacked
us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was able to fell 3 of the 8
tentacles that flailed at us and the group destroyed those remaining.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox and I had come up with a plan to coat the room in fire using Flame
Strike and Fireball.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox would be the benefit of my Resist Elements
spell�attuned to resist fire�and hopefully with his skill as a Monk and some
luck Nox could escape being burned to death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This plan, however, was not enacted though because it took Nox slightly
longer to find the hidden lever to revel the vampires coffin and our group
already anxious forgot the plan and entered the room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon entering the room we discovered something dismaying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The room was magically silenced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Julin
would be able to use none of his magical bardic abilities as magical silence
acts as an anti-magic zone against Julin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
also got a terrible feeling once I entered the room where the vampire slept.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Something was wrong�<o:p>

</span>Nox found the lever and the floor slid back to reveal a coffin about 20
feet below the surface of the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was not long until we were face-to-face with the vampire and doing battle with
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During the battle Mewn was
dominated and ordered to attack me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
was in the corner of the room when suddenly Mewn struck me with her sword. <o:p>

</span>The battle continued as Thrommel kept trying to dominate other members of
our group while Quadro took the fight to Thrommel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro climbed into the pit to attack Thrommel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro delivered solid attacks with his weapon and Thrommel likewise used
his sword on Quadro.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I kept
expecting Rask to use some Unbringer power or bleat holy light or something but
he did not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I continued to fire
arrows into the vampire all the while trying to avoid Mewn who kept cutting into
me with her sword.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I knew she was
dominated and I was using the spell shield and instead of focusing on the
vampire I used shield to guard me against Mewn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The shield helped foil 2 of her attacks but still she was hurting me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At one point Mewn attacked me the same way I saw her attack earlier at
the gymnasium where she�d been training and I was able to dodge her attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was almost as if Mewn was trying to kill me but by attacking me in
exactly the same way as I saw in the gymnasium she was trying to give me a way
to avoid her assault.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some part of
Mewn was trying to fight the domination and while she could not refuse an order
I think Mewn resisted in all the ways she could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox saw Quadro was seriously wounded and with his great speed Nox swept
into the pit grabbing Quadro and in seconds the 2 were outside the room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I didn�t know Nox and Quadro had formulated a plan of sorts while in
the silenced area so at first I thought Nox was just getting Quadro to safety
lest he die�but though that served a secondary, coincidental, purpose the true
reason was for Quadro to cast a spell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro
polymorphed the vampire into a fish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
was exceedingly glad because I felt the battle could be won with this sudden
turn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since vampires can change
shape the polymorph would only last a short while since once the vampire tried
to change shape the polymorph spell would be broken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This gave us just enough time to nearly destroy the vampire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the undead creature tried to turn to mist Nox, Rask and Quadro were
there to answer with swift attacks�with all our efforts the vampire Thrommel
was destroyed and a great evil was banished from the world.<o:p>

</span>All that remains is to Planeshift, after Rask rests and prays for his
spells, to The Seven Heavens resurrect Thrommel and rightfully return him to
Furyondy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If we can achieve the
feat of returning Thrommel to life before the cultist and if Thrommel himself
wants to be resurrected then and only then will a great good be returned to the
world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can stand for some good
right now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As I stay awake and
everyone else sleeps I am inwardly praying to Rao and telling him all that has
occurred involving Thrommel and I am asking his guidance involving the dark god
as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I pray to Rao because of
what he means to me and what he does mean to the world at large.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As I wrote earlier the conflict with the forces of The Temple of
Elemental Evil is older than this journal and in fact ancient though not ancient
beyond reckoning.<o:p>

</span>The Word of Incarum, the most Holy Scripture of the adherents of Rao,
teaches that the Lord of peace granted the humans of Oerth the moons Celene and
Luna.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was done so that the
light might bring guidance from the tyranny and darkness of an age ruled by
dreaded Tharizdun. I chose to worship Rao because he gave light to an otherwise
dark world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the face of
unrelenting and suffocating evil Rao gave light, celestial light, to guide the
humans of Oerth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not choose
their path but instead illuminated the darkness giving rise to possibilities
where none existed before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To be
always at peace and in harmony and yet lend great help to the forces of good
without fighting or using subterfuge is a wondrous thing indeed.<o:p>

</span>All I could say was �Not normal.� And I must have offended her
because she gave me a look I have not seen since she was dark Mewn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She asked me what I meant and I said�something to her that made her
�happy� and she smiled at me and said �Me either.�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Papyrus">Many things have happened to us
since last I wrote.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn was killed
by the combined efforts of an Earth Elemental and a Stone Giant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was beside her when she was struck down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I used a healing arrow to try and keep her alive but she perished before
my eyes and I was powerless to help her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
don�t know what more I could have done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn
was killed after the group walked up a short spiral staircase and opened a door.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I stayed behind in case the staircase and the crumbling
ceiling collapsed since I would be the only one left to dig them out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The staircase held and when the group opened the door Mewn was quickly
and savagely attacked.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I raced to the aid of the group and seeing Mewn critically
hurt I shot her with a healing arrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn
thanked me and then another attack from the stone creatures killed Mewn and I
had no say in the matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes
things happen quickly�to quickly to do anything except be a part of what is
occurring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Papyrus">After deliberation we decided to
raise Mewn form the dead rather than true resurrect her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This would leave Mewn weaker than before she died but it would return her
to us now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro, Meepo and Nox
felt that time was of the essence where The Elder Elemental Eye was concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Time was a problem and leaving to resurrect Mewn could be all the time
needed to free Tharizdun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>MY
friends feel dark things are on the rise and so I took the words of my friends
soberly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I too think time is
running out for us to find a way to thwart the plans of the evil cultist.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I only hope Mewn understands what we must do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I pray she will be strong enough to endure what is coming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

is at hand�the end and the beginning will at once be the same.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If the cultist win a horrid age of darkness could befall the land and it
will be a new beginning for Tharizdun and his minions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Certainly it will be the end of all my friends and myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But if we are the victors and thwart the plans of releasing Tharizdun
from his prison then a new beginning for our group might be possible.<span style="mso-spacerun:

focus on our lives, family and the future.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Papyrus">Mewn was raised from the dead
and as Nox said she was weaker but this time I didn�t sense the same
trepidation from her as in the past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn
seems to be dealing with being killed more easily now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am not sure that is a good thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact I wasn�t worried but now I am worried.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>After returning Mewn to her body we carried on down more
passageways until we met of all people Kellah.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Kellah is a ranger who told us not to build a fire near the temple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Funny she doesn�t remind me of Menyoh anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Wonder why?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Kellah told us
of a Beholder that is in a pit and of several other dangers but I don�t know
what she said after she spoke of the Beholder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I met a Beholder when I was training to become a soldier in the Harmonium
and from what I understand the creatures are very powerful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Beholders I know can emit anti-magic rays from their central eye and
direct eyestalks to devastating effect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
always hover and can fly, sort of, from place to place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I know Beholders are vicious in battle and being told one blocked our way
made me ill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I felt several of us
might die fighting the creature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
discussed at length a plan to kill the Beholder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was most concerned with Nox being worried as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But Quadro and Drak acted like it would not be a problem at
all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is something we have to do
is how they looked at the coming battle with the Beholder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No one was more apprehensive than I was about the Beholder and what could
happen to us.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The battle was joined with Nox leading the way Mewn close behind and
Meepo using magic to phase through a wall to attack the Beholder.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox, Mewn and Meepo attacked the Beholder one after the
other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox actually dodged 3 rays
that shot from the eyestalks and then he leaped into the pit and struck the
creature a telling blow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was the
most amazing site as Mewn and Meepo each attacked once and then it was over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Beholder was slain by Nox, Meepo and Mewn alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I looked at Quadro and told him it was dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro from where he stood couldn�t even see the Beholder yet and in
seconds the creature had been felled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
all cheered and roared with laughter that the abomination was dead.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After the battle with the Beholder some of us namely Rask got it in his
head we were too tough to beat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
killed the abomination and it did nothing to us�Ha-Ha-Ha.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Well, not long after the Beholder fight Rask changed his mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I should hope he did anyway.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We were faced with Stone giants, as many of us as there were them, which
tested our resolve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I noticed Rask
being beaten badly by the giants and I thought he might die if he was not
helped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I fired my arrows and
attacked as I could but it was Meepo, Nox and Quadro who did the most to help
the situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn dodged in and
out of harms way and Drak harried the creatures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Julin used his sonic strike until he was backed into a corner and like
Drak and Rask found himself pinned by the giants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mewn, Quadro and me attacked Stone giants that were threatening our more
hurt comrades and Meepo used intense fire to burn the giants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Several times it looked like we might be overwhelmed but we were able to
survive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Actually I thought Rask
had been killed but later I saw him up but bloody and in need of healing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Except for the battle with the Arrowhawks, I spelled the name wrong
before, I have never been closer to dying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I could feel my body giving out during the fight just like when we faced
the Arrowhawks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a feeling I
don�t like being reminded of.</font></p>

</span>As I said so much has happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All
of us are pushing our skills and abilities to the limit every day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>All of us are trying to expand our abilities, learn new things and be
part of a team.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It isn�t easy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not
easy for me anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I find myself
thinking that I am the weakest member of the group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The rest of the group has discovered or invented ways to battle the enemy
and at all times each of them seem to be stretching the bounds of what is
possible for them as a person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
feel like I, sometimes, am just Numenarh with a bow and nothing more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides my arrows flying and words of encouragement what do I offer the
group?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing is what else I offer
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I know I am friend to every
member and they are friends to me but from a battle standpoint I can only fire
arrows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have no great magic to
unleash or special battle tactics that help me dodge attacks and hold hallways
like Nox.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I cannot tumble or
cartwheel behind my enemies and take them unaware.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I can�t hurl sonic attacks with unrelenting fury or change shape into
hulking animals like Drak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I cannot
heal with divine magic that I can claim my own neither can I call down divine
fire or slay the living with a touch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
can do none of these things or even as much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am simply Numenarh with a bow�and nothing more�it is all I know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When Celeste taught me the art of Arcane Archery I didn�t realize the
commitment and work that would be needed to gain any results at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have studied and trained my mind and honed my body and tried as best I
can but I have yet to master, or even learn, how to use magic to alter my arrows
to great effect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can enchant them
with guiding magic but have not learned the truly magnificent ways of the Elven
war bands as yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don�t know if
my skills and talents will be of much use to my friends when the battle that
means everything comes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I know
this I will die for them if I must.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
the only help I can give them is my death then my death it shall be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I will do whatever I must to stand in the way of what would harm the
group so that they might win the day.</font></p>

whom first asked me if I was a Ranger and I responded:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>�I Range.�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Has become a
soul to be reckoned with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
ability to wield magic and protect not only himself but also others has grown
and expanded in scope and aspect that none could have guessed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Julin was made a Knight by the king of Furyondy and he deserved it even
before the rescue of Thrommel.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Papyrus">Rask, Unbringer and destroyer of
evil was an ill tempered and lazy Cleric of St. Cuthbert when I met him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Now Rask can channel great divine forces and wield divine magic to strike
down his enemies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The power Rask
has gained dismays me at times because I see the gleam in his eye when dark
radiance surges over his hands and he kills with a touch or calls down divine
fire or achieves some other feat worthy of, I think in his mind, so few.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rask is still lazy but not as ill tempered for the most part.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He seems to have growing animosity toward Quadro and a dislike of Julin
seems to be resurfacing. But above all I am concerned about his snide and
rebellious comments to Quadro and lackluster willingness to heal the injured.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rask was made a Knight by the king of Furyondy and he does deserve it
though I think Rask believes he deserves much more than Knighthood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I often wonder what Rask thinks the world owes him�coin, a living,
reverence?</font></p>

</span>Meepo, the sorcerer has come from humble beginnings to arise as one of
the most mighty of our group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meepo
has a kind heart but each day as he learns more he becomes more and more like
those he hangs around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meepo is
losing his naivete.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meepo is
gaining power and ego.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I think
Meepo can handle such things better than Rask can and so I don�t really worry
about Meepo becoming pompous and self-centered and ultimately a bad Kobold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meepo is powerful and his magical talents have helped us and in truth
saved us at times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meepo was made a
Knight by the king as well and Meepo, the sorcerer deserves each and every
privilege knighthood entails.</font></p>

lot�the spell chills and freezes things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Drak is a Druid and a difficult fellow to figure out by any standard I
know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He is cold and standoffish
and takes to wondering around at times and he can go days without speaking to
any of us save his bear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Drak was
made a knight by the king of Furyondy though the king dislikes Drak personally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Drak doesn�t care if the king or any king likes him or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>Nox, the Githzheri is careful and reckless all in the same.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox can usually meet the challenges for himself that he sets so his
recklessness is more than not a self-imposed trial by fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox does not speak often but when he does his opinion is listened to and
given great weight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox has never
endangered the group and does all he can to protect us and shield us from
enemies.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I am proud to call him friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox still has to travel to Furyondy at some point to be officially
knighted and receive his reward if he wants to ask for one that is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am not sure what Nox would want but it will not be for material gain or
show.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox will ask for something
practical and helpful to him in his battle against the cultist or what ever
other evils he may face in the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox
seems to always think ahead but still remain solidly in the moment he is in and
deal with what is now.</font></p>

</span>Nox in the battle with the stone giants was banished in a blaze of light.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I asked Quadro if Nox was dead because I was not sure what
happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The spell was divine and
called Blasphemy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rask had no idea
what it was but Quadro knew and I was glad to learn that at some point perhaps
in a few days to a week Nox could return to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently Blasphemy weakens those native to this world while banishing
or sending back to their native plane all outsiders.<span style="mso-spacerun:

sent Nox back to Limbo made me physically ill.<o:p>

</span>Quadro, the leader has proven himself as a leader and willing to take
great risk to help the group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro
has grown as a leader and leads by majority most of the time but when it is
needed he does step in and make command decisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro has combined a unique fighting style that fits seamlessly with his
adept magical talents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am proud
to call him friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro was
knighted as well and upon being knighted he asked for a fife of land in Furyondy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furyondy is in constant embattlement with Iuz and so asking for a fife of
land is the same as asking for a fight and another fight and a fight again only
to be faced with at some point a war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Skirmishes
and battles are frequent but at some point a full-scale war will erupt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro wants to be a part of it I guess.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Like Julin, Quadro seeks fame but in a different way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I think Quadro wants to be remembered as a great man in history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing is wrong with that as long as he does not lose sight of how he
got famous and why.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dwarves have a
long memory so I am not worried Quadro will forget his friends�or his enemies.<o:p>

add great skill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn has developed
her talents well but learning from her mistakes she doesn�t do so well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I wish she were not scout because is puts her in such constant danger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I would rather Mewn stay in the middle of the group formation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But depriving her of her �wings� and stopping her from doing what she

</span>Mewn takes great pains to make sure evil does not catch us unaware and
for this she should be rewarded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn
was made a Lady, same as a knight, by the king of Furyondy and I can tell it
impressed her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was not sure she
wanted to dance so I did not ask.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
she was dead in my arms at the stair well and after I watched over her body in
the night I felt differently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
should have asked if she wanted to dance and I should have told her that she
means a lot to me as scout and she is a valuable member of the team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>Julin, Nox, Mewn, Meepo and me are awaiting the return of Quadro, Drak

Quadro and Drak teleported away to have Rask returned to life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The rest of the group and I went on searching as we knew the time was
close at hand for the culmination of The Doomdreamers plans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon searching around we found a black altar and upon it a man to be
sacrificed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An Ogre played a drum
and a woman dressed all in black chanted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From
here things get much worse.</font></p>

</span>Julin realized the altar could be used to break Tharizdun from his
prison.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I guess seeing it triggered
something in that vast storehouse of information that is the mind of Julin
Sandar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But things get worse after
this realization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The element of
surprise so rarely ours and more often the enemies became lost, as usually
occurs with us, and replacing it was stark terror.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>2 town people we had rescued transformed into tiger-like creatures with
scowling faces and backward hands that only added to their dark charisma.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Truly these creatures looked at us as playthings to be done with what
ever their wicked minds could conceive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Glaring
intelligence could be seen in their eyes and before any of us could make
reactions both tiger-like humanoids began to cast spells.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With time against us and minus Quadro, Drak and Rask we all looked at one
another and committed ourselves to the fight in a flash.<o:p>

</span>Julin sent sonic attacks at the drum playing Ogre and the drum fell
silent as the Ogre fell dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meepo
cast fly upon me to give us the advantage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We were in a room with a 60� ceiling so me able to fly about and send
arrows down upon the enemy would be of great use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ha! Ha!<o:p>

</span>The Tiger- like creatures began to fly as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The creatures were regaled with defensive magic and it seemed that
neither magic, nor arrow could penetrate their defenses or harm their hide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I got even with them in the air and fired arrows to no effect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Julin became all but overwhelmed by some magic the altar sent against us
but still Julin used his ability to disrupt thoughts against the Cleric woman at
the altar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His action did not save
the man upon the altar though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
black tentacle erupted from the onyx slab and pulled the sacrifice, apparently,
into the altar itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though I
know the man suffered a much worse fate than being trapped in an altar.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He had become an offering to Tharizdun.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In place of the sacrifice a gift was left the woman in black
robes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just after she put on the
amulet that The Elemental Eye gave her though Julin used his magic to disrupt
her mind while Nox engaged her in hand-to-hand combat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The woman could defend herself but she was unable to cast spells or use
magical items, as her mind was too confused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>Meanwhile Meepo and I along with Mewn were trying to deal with the
Tiger-like humanoids, I must find out what they are called, and each time we
attempted something we were rewarded with fire attacks from enemies no spells or
arrows could harm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I felt we could
still win if someone or I was able to pierce their magical defense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They could not be unbeatable and I knew then that they could be defeated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But how?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>

</span>Earlier before the Tiger-humanoids attacked us and while we planned a
course of action I cast Resist Elements and tuned the spell to resist fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am able to cast this certain spell 2 times and so I gave the fire
resistance to Julin and Mewn.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The Tiger-humanoids kept sending fireball attacks at us and
during the unrelenting assault Meepo fell and was near death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His burned body was giving out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
was struck with fire attacks as well but I managed to withstand their assail. I
can no longer be so simply defeated so I did all that I could to help our cause.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I welcomed the fireball strikes against me because it would save my
friends pain and possibly save them from death.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The cloaked woman was slain by
Nox and with her dead Julin struck out with sonic strikes against the flying
Tiger-like sorcerers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was now I
realized as many fireballs as they have prepared they could only be sorcerers or
very stupid wizards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since we could
not harm them and their defense and strategy confused us so much I tend to think
they were cunning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sorcerers are

ran the walls to get above the Tiger-backward-hand evil minions we did not
prevail.<span style="mso-spacerun:

</span>Nox used a psionic power that Nox calls Mind Blast and with this power
Nox rendered our foes their swansong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
psionic attack from Nox sent the evil backward-hand minions into a momentary
frenzy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The creatures looked
shocked that Nox harmed them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then
a moment after their startled expressions disappeared so too did their look of
superiority and for that matter their glaring intelligence seemed to be gone
too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox had given their minds a
psionic shock and their perceptions were numbed and the very will to fight
quelled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My arrows struck deep
within their evil hide and in a bloody heap the backward-hand evils fell to
their death.<o:p>

the end of the battle though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
had to destroy the altar and Nox was elected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However a curtain, a kind of construct, came to life and attacked Nox.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The once blue curtain took the form of brown-green tentacles and with no
problem they grappled Nox and tried to pin him within their grasp to make him
helpless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I could tell the
tentacles were squeezing the air out of him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox only could take short agonizing gasps of air.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lifted off the ground Nox was nearly helpless as more tentacles tried to
entangle themselves around him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox
somehow prevented several attempts of other tentacles from grabbing hold of him
but he was powerless to cast off the tentacles that were trying to crush him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

the ceiling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We�d won and the
victory had been hard won at that, so it was all the more savored.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am not sure what happened next exactly I just know that an elephantine
fungus creature began screaming in a booming voice that she was a god and our
doom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I with the help of Nox and

massive fungal creature resembling ever vaguely a massive mushroom.<o:p>

</span>I invisible and able to fly soared into the air and quickly cast the Cone
of Cold scroll upon Imix, prince of elemental fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Imix roared in pain as frost met fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro cast an even more powerful Cone of Cold than was bound in my
scroll and Imix yelled to us that we would all die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>To those words Julin let loose with Sonic strikes upon the prince of
fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rask called down holy fury to
harm our enemies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Drak shapeshifted
into a shambling mound in order to attack the Medusa. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Nox
also took on the Medusa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
pairing of Drak and Nox ended quickly what threat the Medusa was to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox was blind by her magic but the second was near death because of Mewn
and Meepo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Imix was swaying to the
symphony of his own destruction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each
sonic strike of Julin was joined by words of magic by Rask and Quadro.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The chanting and fighting was all I could hear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>How strangely it did sound like music to me toward the end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Each arrow I sent was punctuation to the spells, deeds and words or my
friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Together we destroyed Imix.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I got the killing strike but without all of us working in near perfect
harmony to undo Imix, none of us or I alone, would have had the privilege of the
final strike on Imix.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Together we
were strong and unstoppable when it counted most.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We did not win without consequences.<o:p>

</span>Aeris was slain by Imix.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro
also fell to the withering attacks of the prince of fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We were without a leader.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro
lay dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Aeris and Quadro never
got to see us bring an end to Imix.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
I am sure they will be able to read about it after Julin writes it into his so
called Epic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No one else was slain
during the fight in the throne room. I worried about Mewn and Julin during the
fight yet they managed to not get killed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of
course to explain the skill, hard work and luck it took for any of us to live
through it would take far longer than I intend to sit here and write in this
journal.<o:p>

used a Druid spell called Last Breath to bring me back to life.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">After getting Quadro returned to life I told him Julin
would explain what occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
all Julin and Quadro would be traveling to Furyondy with Lareth as prisoner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Knowing Quadro as I do I know he would want to travel with Julin to see
Belvor <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">IV</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro and Julin headed off to Furyondy and just after they
were out of sight I asked Rask and Drak to travel back to Rastor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I wanted Drak to keep an eye out in the wilderness for cultist for awhile
and I asked Rask to start up a Temple of St. Cuthbert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I turned to Nox and asked him to be the Sheriff of Rastor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox said he had a few things to do but that he would be happy to make his
way to Rastor later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I nodded to
him and we exchanged a brief smile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
spoke with Mewn too and our conversation let me know she was going to the Roost
and that she wanted to spend time with her resurrected father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I understood and it was then I told everyone my plans.<o:p>

</span>Using my limited yet useful knowledge of Verbobonc laws and customs that
I learned while in SIGIL�thank you Tripicus for all your help---during
research I managed to be made Mayor of Rastor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I think being knighted by Belvor <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">IV</b>
helped me considerably more than my meager understanding of the government of
Verbobonc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None the less
Rastor had become my responsibility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Legally
and officially my responsibility this time though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I knew I would have to leave and go to SIGIL and also I wanted to visit
Hishn so I left Rastor in the capable hands of Barkin Leatherhand, Nox and a man
I have only recently met but trust considerably.<o:p>

</span>Ambergost is a sorcerer and a diplomat of Verbobonc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ambergost was appointed to help me take care of the government of Rastor
and show me more how to do my job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
addition he will act as Mayor while I am away in SIGIL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ambergost is a very charismatic fellow and unless something pressing
happens Ambergost will stay for one year as liaison between Rastor and Verbobonc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ambergost is also an expert craftsman and woodworker and his skills with
wood and brick are needed and appreciated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As regal and noble as he appears Ambergost quickly took to helping build
things or fixing what needed to be repaired.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>After traveling around for some while getting everything in order I was
able to head toward Hishn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On my
way I met with a Troll and it attacked me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Suddenly flaming arrows struck the Troll and as I backed away yet another
arrow struck home this one carrying with it a ball of fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>From out of the woods stepped a half-Elven man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I knew he too was an Arcane Archer from the way his arrows held spells.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He carried a quiver like mine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
commented on how efficient the quivers were for us archers and after some more
talking we made camp together.<o:p>

</span>That night I found out more about Neunah Treewillow.<span style="mso-spacerun:

</span>Last Neunah heard his father was in the Vesve fighting a massive forest
fire rumored to be the work of Iuz.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
has been some time since the fire and Neunah has not received word from his
father whom promised to write him each Month.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Until now the letters have never failed to arrive more than 2 or at most
4 days later than the end of the Month.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
don�t know what has befallen Eruja Treewillow and I dare not get involved if I
want to return home in 3 days hence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet
if Neunah asks me to help him I will join him in his endeavors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>I feel like it has been far longer, than is the truth, that I have been
gone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I hurried by the School of
Tal and met, luckily, with Master Deddashar and he told me that Arkay, Wilstway,
Olen and Numenarh were about to leave Hishn for some adventure and as Deddashar
saw it lots of damned hard work too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
bid him fair well as I hurried toward home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Master Deddashar told me that the expedition meeting place was none other

could I bumped into several early arrivals at the Hishn marketplace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Toppling melons and knocking over a Halflings cart of goods I had to take
pause to pay for the melons and make several apologies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It did not help that several people on the street knew me and I had to
yell back that I was rushed and needed to get some place but I would visit
later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jersus, Felosial and Amarill
are those that called for me to stop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only
Jersus used my childhood name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Felosial
use to until I asked Menyoh to marry me and since that day Felosial has called
me Numenarh instead of Traearn.<o:p>

  </span>I have never been one to deny him my time so I followed him into his
  room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perenthace told me a number
  of confusing things and then at the last of all the confusing things come the
  most distressing thing of all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
  mother was pregnant and Tenzanier was not the father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus">I have spent 4 Months with the Harmonium and during this
time I have come to appreciate law and completely understand why not 1 Elf or
Pixie lives on Ortho.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Working with
the Harmonium is hard since sometimes they take the long way around or the long
view to a problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Other times,
this is rare though, the Harmonium undertakes secret missions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One mission I was involved in was planting a perfectly symmetrical garden
behind a dwelling.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I don�t know the purpose of such a �mission� but mostly
the Harmonium functions without such oddity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mostly.</font></p>

</span>I talked with Tripicus again while I was in SIGIL and he told me he
thought I was doing fine in my endeavors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
commented that I mentioned Mewn and Tenzanier a lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I miss the group that much is true.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It seems that each of us has gone our separate ways.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Rask barely did any real work on the temple of St. Cuthbert
before he left to climb the steps of somewhere and do other things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Of course I did not know this until I returned to Rastor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am writing this Entry in Rastor and in my new home.</font></p>

  </span>During the 4 Months I was gone Ambergost and Barkin built me a house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Mayor needs a home don�t he is what Barkin said and after seeing it
  and sitting at the table and eating here I realized something.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The group is gone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am no
  longer a part of an adventuring group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox
  I see every day but I have not seen Rask since before I departed Rastor and
  left Ambergost in charge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ambergost
  did an amazing job while I was gone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nicolbolas
  is hard at work finishing up the Temple of Rao while the St. Cuthbert temple
  is only half finished and with Rask gone not much is being done in the way of
  finishing the thing either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rask
  left word with Drak where he was going but Drak refuses to say anything about
  where Rask went.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Drak just smiles
  and says: � If he ain�t here he is near and dear.�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I grimaced when Drak said that about Rask and then I kind of agreed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I have not seen Drak since the day after my return and I have been in
  Rastor now 2 Months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Drak
  reported no cultist or specific bad stuff though he and Nox did take out a
  small band of thieves that were trying to rob from people who wanted to come
  and live in Rastor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People
  actually coming to Rastor to live are a minor miracle unto itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Whom am I kidding I even Miss Rask�</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-tab-count:1"><font face="Papyrus">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font>
</span><font face="Papyrus">I asked Nox if any of the adventuring group had come to Rastor during the
time I was gone to SIGIL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox told
me that Quadro teleported in 3 times during the 4 Months I was gone.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently Quadro has a tower now and it is something of a
small stronghold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox said Quadro
told him that the king granted him a tower.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Amazing to me was that when I asked Nox what Julin got for delivering
Lareth to Furyondy for imprisonment and our other minor deeds like saving the
world Nox replied: �Nothing.�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Being
granted a tower by a king is a big deal in itself and I suppose the king
believed at the time that Quadro would have a group to man and upkeep the tower.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But the adventuring group is apparently no more so I wonder who is
helping Quadro upkeep the tower?</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It has been just more than 8 Months since I have seen Mewn, Meepo and
Julin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been 6 months since I
have seen Rask and 2 Months has gone by and Drak is no place to be found.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox says Drak is like that and Drak will show up when Drak is
needed�mostly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have seen Quadro
once during the 8 Months since we defeated Imix and captured Lareth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro stayed for a short while and in fact so short a time I was not
able to show him my new home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro
and I talked of his tower and how he was gathering a following that worked with
him to maintain the tower and his fife of land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro has had a few minor problems but for the most part he is doing
well for himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meepo has spent
much of his time with Quadro, as I figured, and he too helps with the tower
stronghold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quadro always wanted to
be remembered and so goes a milestone for the Dwarf.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have written Mewn a letter of sorts and sent it by messenger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She knew I would be gone for some time to SIGIL and that I needed to stay
in Rastor when I returned but to not have gotten a letter or some message from
her in 8 Months is perplexing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
agreed we had so much to talk about yet she has made no effort to contact me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In truth until now I have made no effort to contact anyone either�</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Papyrus"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We have all, for the most part, gone our separate ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quadro has his men and tower stronghold.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Meepo works with Quadro.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Julin on occasion, I hear from Quadro, drops by but does not stay at the
tower like he and Meepo do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nox I
see every day and Rask has yet to return and help finish the work on the temple
of St. Cuthbert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mewn is in
Verbobonc I guess but knowing Mewn she could be any place at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She may have even gone to the Gymnasium to work with the
Ciphers?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wonder where Mewn is?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And some place out in the woods is Drak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nox isn�t one for conversation but he gets the job done�I see him
every day.</font></p>

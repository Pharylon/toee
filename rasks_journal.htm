<p align="center"><b>First Entry (no date)</b></p>
<p align="left">It has been two months since I woke up here in the temple. The clerics tell me that if I write it would help to ease the pain so here goes.</p>
<p align="left">Two months ago my home was attacked by this creature. Well not really a creature I guess it did walk like a man. Anyway it attacked and my mother and father fought back. Dad with his sword and mom with her magic. I was busy protecting my two younger siblings. My sister and brother. I saw my father go down and he did not get back up. Than my mom stopped fighting and just stood there. I did not know why. This thing walked past her and came towards me I tried to protect my brother and sister but he knocked me away and I passed out. When I came to he was standing over me laughing. I remember him saying something about the future can be changed. Than he reached down for me. I prayed to
St.Cuthbert for protection and than there was a brilliant flash of light and I passed out. When I awoke I was at the temple. The clerics will not talk about how I got there and so I do not ask anymore, all they will say is that I am the only one left from my family. It still hurts to think about it. I do not know if I will write!&nbsp;
It hurts too much to think about my family. So I say goodbye.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Second Entry (no date)</b></p>
<p align="left">Well hello again, it has been two years since I wrote in this old journal.</p>
<p align="left">I have learned how to be a cleric mom would be proud that I am following in her footsteps. Dad would understand I never cared for the sword so being a paladin like him wouldn't do. Anyway I am writing now because something strange happened yesterday that made me remember what happened two years ago. An elf came to temple looking for me. He said that his mother wrote a prophecy about me and that the time has come for me to leave. I did not understand. He than showed me the prophecy and told me to keep it so that I would always remember and not let my guard down at any anytime. He also told me that my mother was not dead not in a sense of the way. Apparently the creature that attacked my home was something known as a vampire and he took my mom to be his bride. This elf told me that
Naserul Morlo would be back for me one day. Remember what happened to my family I cannot let that happen to the good clerics of this temple so I guess it best that I leave. I do not know where I will go all I know is that I
will be alone in this world for how can I have friends if every day I am in danger and therefore anyone with me will also be in danger. This guy told me that he would find me again later when I am ready. He must be talking about the prophecy. It does mention something about me learning new skills never seen before. I guess this vampire guy does not want me to learn them. What bothers me most about the prophecy is the part where I am destined to meet him and only one will live. Not too comforting. I guess I know my path in life now to live and travel alone I will have to change my last name so that it will not be easier for him to find me. Do not get me wrong I am not hiding from him but I know that I am not ready to face him yet. But the day will come so I
wait alone. But do you want to know what scares me more than that. The day that I see my mom again. I know that she is no longer human that she is undead and needs to be set free. But still she is my mom will I have to strength to kill her. I cry to think
of what I must do. This is my torment this is my life. Goodbye my only friend I leave tonight to be alone forever.&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b>Third Entry (no date)</b></p>
<p align="left">Hello again my friend. It has been two years of me being alone. I am tired of being lonely I want to have friends but should I dare. Maybe I can make friends just for a few days and than I could always leave again. It is so hard being alone. I have been sitting here out side of the town wondering if I should make friends or just go in for supplies and than leave again.<br>
</p>
<p align="left">I sit staring at the town longing for friends. It has been four years since the attack maybe I am not even the one in the prophecy maybe that elf was wrong. What could it hurt I will go wish me luck my friend.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>Fourth Entry (no date)</b></p>
<p align="left">Well I went into the town and guess what right away I ran into a group of adventures who were going to someplace called the Sunless Citadel and they could use a cleric so I volunteered to go. It is only for a few days and than I will leave again. I promise it would feel good to use my talents again. I know that they could use some healing. Well we will be off
tomorrow so I better get some sleep fill you in later.</p>

<p>I was killed by a Salamander and by an arrow from Numenarh. Numenarh
accidentally shot me and it helped cause me to die. Either way I died and when I
was brought back to life I was in the first plane of the seven Heavens. I will
write more about all the wonders I saw there later on but for now I want to
write about the things I read in the giant library they have on the first plane
of heaven. This guy named Vit planeshifted me to the first plane of heaven and I
was given a small tour by a Lantern Archon. They showed me the silver sea. I
will write more about what I saw later but for now let me put down what I
learned about vampires while reading in the holy library.</p>
<p>Vampires are way more powerful that I was thinking they would be and I am
glad I found that out before I fight the Elven vampire. Vampires are resistant
to magic and are not effected by mind affecting spells at all. They are easily
killed by direct sunlight but anything else will not hurt them anywhere near as
much. They can dominate the mind of a living person and crush their will and
make them do whatever the vampire wants them to do. This is very bad. The
vampire if he gains control of one of the group this way could cause us to have
to kill each other before we can kill the vampire. This would not be good.
Vampires can also change shape and become bat or wolves. They can also summon
wovles or bats or rats to attack us too. Vampires can become gaseous and fly
around too. Vampires can be drained of their undead lifeforce if held under
running water unless they could swim as a mortal. If they can swim as a mortal
then they are not hurt by being held under water. Vampires heal extremely fast
and are resistant to most any kind of damage if not from magic or magic items.
Vampires can climb walls just like a spider. They can climb onto ceilings and
smooth walls easily and they can also fly if they turn into a mist.</p>
<p>How to kill a vampire: Direct Sunlight, a wooden stake paralyzes it and then
you should cut off the head and fill the mouth with holy wafers or something
like that. The stake should be plunged through the heart to paralyze the vampire
and cutting off the head and the wafers finishes up the job nicely.</p>
<p>A vampire cannot enter your home unless invited and a mirror can be used to
make it run away if you get the vampire to see its reflection. A area laced with
garlic can keep the vampire away too.</p>

<p>I have my mothers mirror and I will use it if I have to but I would rather
destroy the evil vampire the first time we meet. The guy who trained me calls me
an Unbringer. I guess that means I am an undead killer. I am understanding more
and more the powers of the Unbringer and know that the time will come soon when
I must fight the Elven-vampire barbarian who killed my family and I will be
ready for him. More than ready I will crush him because the people of the first
level of Heaven have given me holy water from the silver sea and let me read
books about the vampire. I asked could I come back and they told me I was
welcome anytime. I will go back soon as I can but I will tell the group what I
learned about vampires first and then start getting my plans together and
finished so I will be ready for the vampire when he comes. Numenarh is worried
about facing the vampire but I told him not to worry but have not told him why
not to worry yet. I want to get my plans all in order before I tell eveyone what
I want to do. Do some research and figure out what is best to do first.</p>
<p>With everything I have learned and being ressurected on the first plane of
Heaven I have changed my outlook on life. I want to be as good as I can and as
holy as possible so I can go beyond the first level of Heaven and all the way to
the seventh level. No more of this letting Quadro attack people or do some other
such not so good things. No letting Mewn or Julin steal. I don't think either
have stolen in a long time but I won't let it go on in the future either. I
can't let them kill people who are not a threat anymore or torture that Gnome
who tortured and killed all those people either. The Gnome deserves to die but
not be tortured slowly to death. I want to do justice not vengence. I want to
act as a holy man not just a man anymore. The trip to Heaven has changed me more
than the group will ever know. The next time someone in the group does something
evil or wrong I am going to stop them or fix the wrong they did if I can. I
brought back those guys that Quadro killed to fix what was done wrong and I
found out from the corpse, the woman Mewn killed, what Mewn did to her. Mewn was
cursed at the time so I don't blame her for what she did. We got the woman
returned to life too. I can't let cheating or lying go on unless it us for an
ultimate good or against undead or something just as inhuman and terrible. So I
almost always will not allow lying and cheating and stealing and killing of
innocent people like the guards Quadro killed or like the guards we have been
fighting. The guards should not be killed when they are defenseless or when they
give up. I just can't allow that to happen anymore if I expect to get to the
seventh level of Heaven.</p>
<p>I think my dadd would be proud of me and happy I am taking up his way of
thinking and acting. My mom and the rest of my family would be very proud</p>
<p>of me too. I am going to one day after I kill the vampire bring my entire
family back to life on the first plane of Heaven. I am sure my family would love
to live there and if it is okay with the beings there I will make my family a
home on the first plane of Heaven where nothing evil can ever hurt them again.</p>
<p>My father was a Paladin and when I true ressurect him he will be again and my
mom was a cleric and she will be that again and they were very holy and my
brother and sister were very good too so I don't think anyone on the first plane
of the seven Heavens will mind my fmaily bieng up there safe where nothing evil
or bad can happen to them. Especially since all they have been through and the
things I will have done by then to get them back from the dead. It is going to
take a lot to kill the vampire defeat the Evil Temple Clerics and finally bring
back my family. I hope to be able to bring them back all by myself some day. I
want my family back and safe in Heaven so this is going to be the thing I go
after. I hope the group can understand my new way of thinking and acting cause
if they can't it is going to be really hard on them if I have to correct them
all them time or stand against the things they do that are not nice or kind of
evil. But I cannot ignore what I saw on the first plane of the seven Heavens or
how it changed me. Well I need to go about getting supplies and thinking about
the best way to kill the vampire and tell the group what Iearned too.</p>
<p>I will be writing more often now that I have found my true purpose in life
because I want to be able to look back on what I wrote and see how I am getting
more holy or where I slipped up and need to get better at. Rereading your own
words can make you see things different especially if you wait awhile and then
reread you words. Everything can seem different to you then and I want to be
able to go back and see how I feel different and why. So I am going to write
about my journey to become more and more good and holy. Well enough for now it
is getting very late at night and I will have to get up soon because I see
Numenarh taking watch and that means four hours has already gone by because Mewn
has gone to meditate and Numenarh has taken her place at watch. I see Numenarh
looking at me and I know he can see me in the firelight better than I can see
him but I can still see the muscles rippling in his arm and I can make out that
tight little ass of his as he sits by the tree. One of these days I am going to
tell Numearh how I feel but not yet and not for awhile.
Goodnight<b><i><u>Rask</p>
